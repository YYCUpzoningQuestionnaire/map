",Yes,,,"We need to honor THE WISDOM OF NEIGHBORS AND THE POWER OF COMMUNITY. Resident power is central to Just Communities protocol, of which I strongly believe.

A risk assessment should be done, Good Neighbour Agreements and check and balances in place to ensure the best operation possible.  The Municipal Development Plan states that these uses should be small in nature and spread throughout the City.  I have researched this topic extensively and we have plotted 20,000 data points which clearly shows there are impacts to community safety.  It is particularly an issue if it is a ""no barrier shelter"" use which allows drugs and alcohol which often increases social disorder and crime as a result.  The community's voice should never be muted.  ",,No,,New apartment builts should incorporate 20% affordable within the development.

It would be ideal if we did not need cars but due to our climate and the urban sprawl of our City this is unlikely.  I support incentives to use other forms less polluting.   Ultimately, the parking minimum should be based on context and community character and not a ""one size fits all"" as this clearly is not working in some communities. ",,No,,,Yes,,,,,No,,Yes,,,"I believe we should try and protect trees as much as possible.  One of my issues with blanket rezoning is it often means the removal of large trees which will take decades to regrow.  While the default is to protect the tree canopy, there might be a situation where this may not be possible, it depends on the situation and context.  One example of my work on International Avenue was 300 trees being planted along 17th Avenue SE to put the Forest in Forest Lawn in the late 1990's.  With the reconstruction many of them would be destroyed.  I convinced Transportation Infrastructure a plan to relocate these trees (the Great Tree Move) to other parts of Calgary.  The Transportation Infrastructure department allowed us to do just that and we were able to save over 150 large caliper elms, green ash and schubert's from the compost heap.

0,,No,,"No, I did not support the blanket upzoning bylaw, and still do not support.     I believe Calgary housing problem has gone bad to worse— but it is even made worse with the blanket re-zoning.  We need a zoning that works wiith community and the right kind of housing: homes that are actually affordable, accessible, and designed with community input. Blanket rezoning ignored neighbourhood identity, infrastructure realities, and accessibility needs.     If seniors in wheelchairs cannot live in these units, or if families working two jobs and cannot afford them, or a young generation with degree and good paying jobs cannot afford them, then the rezoning has failed. If elected, I will move to repeal blanket rezoning and replace it with a community at heart, real engagement approach housing strategy that delivers homes Calgarians can actually afford and live in, not being forced out!   ",Yes,,,"Yes, I will advocate and vote to repeal the blanket upzoning bylaw.    Repeal must not mean going backwards — it must mean going back to community choice with getting it right at first. Restoring R-C1 and R-C2 zoning as the default gives neighbourhoods back their voice, including the mechanism of re-appealing process. From there, I will work with residents, community associations, and planners to introduce thoughtful, context-based rezoning that reflects each neighbourhood’s capacity, identity, and needs.    In short: repeal to restore neighbourhood-level planning discretion, and replace top-down imposition with bottom-up, community-driven housing solutions.    ",Yes,,,"Yes, I support restoring the previous land use districts and contextual rules.    Repeal should restore the system where neighbourhoods had a voice through public hearings and land use redesignations. This ensures growth is done with communities, not imposed on them, and ensures there is an engagement process that is beyond a check box.     At the same time, I believe we can strengthen the old framework with clearer and well defined affordability, accessibility standards, and community engagement process, so communities get both meaningful input and housing that serves residents.  ",Yes,,,"Yes, I believe Calgarians should have the right to vote by plebiscite on major city-wide planning decisions.    Blanket rezoning every neighbourhood does not only affect us now, it affects the next generation in Calgary and such questions and if we do not get it right at first, it does undermine trust.     A plebiscite would give Calgarians a direct voice on decisions that affect their homes and quality of life.    While plebiscites are not legally binding unless adopted by council, I believe City Hall must respect the outcome on fundamental city-wide issues like rezoning.  ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Community voices must never be treated as a box to check. The 2024 blanket upzoning stripped away local hearings and replaced them with a one-size-fits-all system. That’s not real consultation — it’s top-down planning.    Growth is necessary, but it must be done with communities, not imposed on them.  ",,No,,"No, I do not support reclassifying these discretionary uses as permitted.    These are sensitive community decisions with real impacts on safety, infrastructure, and neighbourhood character. Removing hearings and appeals strips residents of their voice.     Especially, in many cases where many in Ward 9 echoed that things are brought into their community without considering their voice or what resources the community actually have.     As a councillor, I will fight to protect community voice by keeping public notice, hearings, and appeal rights in place for these types of developments.  ",,No,,"No — Calgary’s blanket upzoning bylaw has not been effective in improving housing affordability.    Affordability means housing costs at 30% or less of income. By that measure, blanket upzoning has failed. Instead of lowering costs, it has driven up land values and speculation, while producing housing types that many Calgarians still cannot afford.    While door knocking, I’ve heard the real human impact of this crisis:       - A retired senior, with a good CPP, who told me she still had to move back into her sister’s basement.      - A single mother working two jobs, fearing she may have to leave Calgary altogether because she can no longer afford rent.      - Families forced to keep their grown kids at home because they can’t afford to live independently.      - A young professional with a degree and full-time job who admitted he still can’t find affordable housing in Calgary.    These are not the outcomes of a policy that is working. Blanket rezoning promised affordability, but it has failed to deliver. True affordability requires policies tied to income, accessibility standards, and housing that actually meets the needs of seniors, families, and working people.    Ward 9 and Calgarians are not looking for lexury house, they are asking for homes for their families today and the next generation to come.     ",Yes,,,"Yes, I agree.    Blanket rezoning fuels speculation and encourages demolitions of affordable homes, replacing them with more expensive units. This may benefit developers and speculators more than renters and families.    At the doors in Ward 9, I’ve heard directly how this plays out:    Seniors tell me about strangers knocking on their doors, pressuring them to sell their homes. For many, it’s become an annoying and unsettling experience to keep being asked to sell out.    Renters share the pain of being handed notices to move out because their rental homes are being sold for redevelopment.    This is especially worrying in East Calgary, where long-standing families and lower-income residents are being displaced by speculative pressure.    True affordability won’t come from blanket rezoning. It requires benchmarks tied to income, accessibility standards, and protections against speculative displacement so Calgarians are not forced out of their homes.  ",Yes,,,"Yes, I am deeply concerned.    Communities like Forest Lawn, Penbrooke, Albert Park-Radisson Heights, and Dover — especially across East Calgary are already reporting displacement pressures. I have sadly seen over 30 families forced to leave neighbourhoods they truly love, with kids pulled from their schools and friends.    I am not a career politician, so I’ll call it what it is: what was supposed to be community revitalization has turned into pure gentrification. Rising land values and redevelopment are pushing out seniors, renters, and families who have lived in these communities for decades.    This issue hits close to home for me. As a former refugee, I know what it means to be displaced. Back then, we lived in a desert land, and after we built a life, an army came and forced us to move again. Coming to Canada, to Calgary, I finally felt at home. I’ll never forget the first time I received a bike from a kind neighbour in Forest Lawn. That was the moment I knew this community was home.    Since then, my family and I have worked every day to serve this city and Ward 9. This is home. And there is nowhere else for those who call Ward 9 and Calgary home to run to. That’s why I am running for council.    Housing policy should strengthen communities, not destabilize them.",,No,,"No, the City has not.    Density without infrastructure planning without getting the basics right first is reckless. More housing means more pressure on roads, sewers, water, schools, parks, transit, and emergency services, but there is no plan or budget to ensure these systems can keep up.    I’ve heard and seen the consequences in Ward 9 and across Calgary:    Families in Penbrooke told me their kids could not attend the same school they’ve been going to for years because capacity was full and they were zoned out.    Residents in Bowness lived through a major water break, and families from Forest Lawn, Erin Woods, Dover, Southview, Penbrooke, and Ogden are already deeply worried about our aging infrastructure.    A senior shared with me how they waited for hours, unable to leave for a doctor’s appointment because a car had blocked their driveway a symptom of overcrowded parking and poor planning.    These are real people paying the price of growth without planning.    As councillor, I will demand infrastructure assessments and funding first before approving major density increases. Calgary must grow, but growth must be sustainable, responsible, and fair to residents.  ",Yes,,,"Yes!    I support phasing or pausing growth until roads, schools, utilities, and emergency services can support it. Otherwise, residents are left with overloaded systems and declining quality of life.  Smart growth must be sustainable and responsible.  ",Yes,,,"Yes!    I fully support requiring Infrastructure Capacity Reviews before approving upzoning or intensification. These reviews must be mandatory and transparent so everyone knows whether sewers, schools, and transit can handle growth.  ",,No,,"No.    Calgary is still a car-dependent city, and the realities vary depending on which community you live in and how far you work. Many families, seniors, and workers in Ward 9, especially in East Calgary, rely heavily on vehicles. Some even commute outside the city to jobs in places like Walmart Logistics in Rocky View County or in High River.    A blanket standard of 0.5 stalls per unit does not reflect these realities. Instead, it creates overflow parking problems, blocked driveways, and safety concerns. It has even led to neighbour disputes over parking and, sadly, reduces community spirit when residents feel they are competing instead of connecting.    Ward 9 deserves context-based parking standards, more flexibility in communities well served by reliable transit, but stronger minimums in areas where transit is weak and people depend on vehicles.    Growth must be practical and respect how Calgarians actually live today.",,No,,"No.    Until Calgary has reliable, city-wide transit that truly serves everyone, eliminating on-site parking requirements is premature. In many communities, especially in Ward 9, people still depend on their vehicles for work, school, and daily life. Removing on-site parking would only push more cars onto already crowded residential streets, creating frustration, safety concerns, and unnecessary conflict between neighbours.    I support a balanced, context-sensitive approach:    Greater flexibility in communities with strong, reliable transit.    Reasonable on-site parking requirements in areas where transit is limited and vehicle use remains essential.    Accessibility safeguards to ensure seniors, families, and people with disabilities are not left behind.    Growth must reflect how Calgarians actually live today, not impose a one-size-fits-all model that ignores current realities.",Yes,,,"Yes, I am concerned.    Calgary’s tree canopy is only 8.25%, one of the lowest of any major Canadian city. Blanket rezoning and increased lot coverage will only accelerate tree loss, further reducing shade, greenspace, and climate resilience.    While door knocking in the community of Penbrooke, many residents shared their frustration over the removal of trees along Penbrooke Dr SE. They feel those trees were part of the character and livability of their street, and their removal has left the community looking bare and less welcoming.    I support tree protection bylaws to safeguard mature trees during redevelopment.    Developer incentives to integrate tree preservation and planting into new builds.    Canopy expansion targets tied directly to redevelopment so we not only protect but grow Calgary’s urban forest.    If we don’t act, blanket rezoning will mean more concrete and less green. Protecting our canopy is essential to a livable and healthy Calgary.",,No,"No.    Parks and greenspaces are essential public infrastructure. They provide health, climate, and community benefits that cannot be replaced.  I will fight to protect existing greenspaces and expand them as Calgary grows.  ",Yes,,,"Yes.    Private lands are critical to Calgary’s tree canopy, and with our coverage already at only 8.25%, we must do more to protect and expand it. I support tree protection bylaws, homeowner incentives, and planting requirements in redevelopment projects to ensure private property owners are part of the solution.    While door knocking in Forest Heights, I met a resident named Brian who had just received six fruit trees from the City’s urban forestry program. When I shared his story, many other community members expressed strong support and said they too would love opportunities to add trees on their private lands.    This shows that residents are not only open but eager to help grow our canopy,  they just need the policies, programs, and support to make it possible.    Protecting and expanding trees on private lands isn’t just good for the environment; it strengthens neighbourhood identity, improves air quality, and makes communities healthier and more livable.  ",Yes,,,"Yes.    Every Calgarian deserves access to parks, fields, and playgrounds. These are not luxuries, they are essential spaces for health, recreation, and community connection.    I’ve seen the impact firsthand as President of the Forest Lawn Community Association. We revitalized a community park, successfully brought in a basketball court, and advocated to build an inclusive playground. These community spaces have re-energized Forest Lawn, creating a place where families gather, kids play safely, and residents take pride in their neighbourhood again. In fact, people from other communities now come to enjoy the park, proving how powerful these investments can be.    As councillor, I will:    Protect existing greenspaces from redevelopment pressure.    Expand playgrounds, fields, and parks in both established and new neighbourhoods.    Ensure every new community is built with vibrant, accessible public spaces that foster pride, inclusivity, and belonging.    Greenspaces are where communities come together, and I will fight to make sure they remain at the heart of Ward 9 and Calgary.  ",Yes,,,"Yes.    Infill should add housing, not destroy community character. I support mandatory design standards on setbacks, privacy, landscaping, and massing, to ensure new builds fit their streets.  ",Yes,,,"Yes.    Heritage is more than buildings.  It’s streetscapes, trees, and history. Blanket rezoning threatens this. I support clear, enforceable standards and incentives to protect Calgary’s identity.  ",Yes,,,"Yes!    I support a thoughtful Growth  planning that aligns with infrastructure capacity, protects greenspaces, and embeds community voices. Blanket rezoning ignored these essentials.  ",Yes,,,"Yes.    Many residents feel that Local Area Plans (LAPs) were predetermined and lacked genuine, open-ended engagement. Too often the consultation process was tightly controlled, with narrow scopes and limited timelines, leaving people feeling that their input didn’t matter.    I support pausing and redrafting LAPs through a process that ensures open, transparent, and meaningful consultation with each affected community.    I was pleased to see that the Greater Forest Lawn Local Area Plan has was paused until after the next city council election. If elected, I will ensure this process is community-focused from start to finish so that residents have a real seat at the table in shaping the future of their neighbourhoods.    Local planning must be bottom-up, not top-down. Communities deserve to trust that their voices are heard and respected.  ",Yes,,,Yes!    Restrictive covenants are legally binding agreements. Ignoring them undermines trust. The City must respect covenants in all planning decisions  ,Yes,,,"Yes!     The City refrain from using special zoning and more so on working with the community or it may undermines trust, fairness, and the rule of law.  ",,,,,,,,,,Ward 9,,,,,,Gar,Gar,,,info@gargarward9.ca,"Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective. Calgary is at a crossroads. We need more housing, but we need it done the right way with affordability, accessibility, infrastructure, and community voice at the centre. Blanket upzoning has failed to deliver on these promises.  As councillor for Ward 9, I will fight for a planning approach that is thoughtful, transparent, and community driven. Growth must respect our heritage, protect greenspaces, strengthen infrastructure, and deliver real affordability.    Together, we can build a Calgary that grows responsibly, sustainably, and in a way that leaves no one behind.    "

0,,No,,"I believe blanket anything is bad public policy. It is essential in city planning that individual situations are treated uniquely, and the needs of communities are considered when developing neighbourhoods. I believe that blanket rezoning, coupled with the current council's handing out planning exemptions like tic tacs, has lead to a what feels like a developer free for all. Blanket rezoning alone cannot blamed the overdevelopment without community consultation Calgarians have been experiencing. Residents of Ward 8 are rightly concerned about seeing 8, 16, or 24 plexes in the middle of blocks and on corner lots. This is not good planning as it is not taking into account the existing infrastructure, traffic, parking, etc. Despite this, I must note that densification is essential for a sustainable Calgary, and one that does not bear an excessive tax burden servicing an ever sprawling city. Though I will advocate for responsible densification in Ward 8, I commit to not do so in a way that ignores community concerns as blanket rezoning does.",Yes,,,"I will advocate and vote for a repeal of blanket rezoning, as well as a broader overhaul of Calgary's zoning bylaws to reduce complexity in the system and make engagement with the planning process more accessible for residents. This will reduce the advantage that well-resourced stakeholders, such as developers, have over community members in influencing the consideration of development applications. As your councillor, I also will give significant time to each ""upzoning"" application and be sure to consider carefully the wishes of the residents when it comes to redevelopment. That said, and I reiterate, we need to densify responsibly, in areas that make sense ",,No,,"I do not believe the previous land use districts effectively address the needs of Calgarians either. Though I do intend to repeal blanket rezoning, I plan to go beyond repealing blanket rezoning and reinstating previous zoning bylaws through a comprehensive simplification of the zoning system that reduces ambiguity in rules, makes planning processes easier for residents to understand, provides clarity on what can and cannot happen in communities, and allow responsible densification with resident input. ",,No,,"Plebiscites are expensive, complicated, and time consuming, and should not be used for decisions such as planning changes. The mayor and councillors elected by Calgarians should be accessible to their constituents, listen to the input of stakeholders, and do their job by representing the interests of the residents of their district.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"All stakeholders, certainly including residents affected by development planning, should always opportunities to have their voices heard on decisions that impact their lives through community consultations and/or engagement following IAP2 guidelines.

Accessibility for community members must always come first in all levels of government, but especially at the municipal level where the choices government makes often greatly impact people's day-to-day lives.",,No,,"Since blanket rezoning was implemented, Calgary has continued to struggle with a crisis in housing affordability. Though I believe densification is an essential element of a plan to ensure residence costs are bearable for Calgarians a developer free for all is not the solution. Densification must be undertaken in a way that ensure affordable housing is being built and residents of existing affordable housing are not displaced. My housing plan includes expanding office to residential conversion programs, encouraging the development of cooperative housing, and private-public partnerships to make use of unutilized public properties that could be developed into housing.",Yes,,,"Without guidance that ensures redevelopments include affordable housing there may be a risk that developers choose to instead build higher value projects which can generate more profit. The next council's housing plan must ensure affordable housing is built through initiatives such as office to residential conversions, cooperative housing, and private-public partnerships.",Yes,,,The displacement of existing residents due to gentrification may be a risk of any redevelopment. We must ensure affordable housing is available for residents and people are not unfairly displaced from their homes. This issue goes beyond blanket rezoning and further protections for tenants should be an element of Calgary's housing strategy.,,No,,"I believe that Calgary needs a simplified zoning system that takes into account the abilities of the city to accommodate all developments. As an element of a future-focused plan for the city, the next council should be sure to plan for growth and accommodate developments.",Yes,,,"If infrastructure cannot support developments it should be upgraded prior to their construction, and development charges should be sufficient to fund their development. Though there may be costs associated with enabling densification by upgrading infrastructure, they will be lower in the long term than the costs required to accommodate further urban sprawl.  ",Yes,,,"The city should consider the infrastructure implications of all developments, whether they are densifying of expanding the city, and ensure the capacity to meet the needs of new developments is present. All city planning should be done with a long term vision. I would, however, note that schools are a provincial responsibility and that the province must be held responsible for providing sufficient education services to Calgarians. ",,No,,"Though I plan to improve transit infrastructure and provide improved transport alternatives to private vehicles, I understand that Calgary remains a car oriented city and residents need to be able to store a car. Whether getting to work or taking their kids to school, Calgarians need to be able to rely on sufficient parking in new developments.",,No,,"I do not support this. 0.5 parking spaces per unit are insufficient for developments and the elimination of parking minimums does not make sense. Limited exemptions to parking minimums may make sense in certain locations such as transit-oriented developments designed for residents to take advantage of transit services, but in such instances residents should not expect parking and should not be permitted to leave vehicles in surrounding communities.",,,Undecided,"This depends on how blanket rezoning is implemented and whether redevelopment is regulated in a way that protects the urban tree canopy.

Rezoning is part of the solution, but it has to be implemented with equity and affordability at the forefront.",Yes,,,"Yes, displacement is a risk in any fast-growing city, which is why we need safeguards alongside rezoning.

That means pairing rezoning with strong renter protections, more purpose-built rental, and tools like secondary suites that let families stay in their communities. The goal should be growth that adds options without forcing people out",,No,,"No. The City has not yet adequately aligned infrastructure and public services with the growth rezoning will create.

Specifically, when it has to do with permitted uses for the housing or treatment of individuals who may have lost their ability to properly care for themselves or others and or pose a threat to the safety of themselves or others. Citizens have the right to be aware of who they are surrounding themselves with.     The City should have to disclose if there is ever the potential for someone to be put in harms way. Transparency is key to preventing unfortunate events like crime, from happening in communities.

In the long run, this costs buyers more when they realize the deficiencies and issues resulting from the fast track build.     There have also not been any specific affordable housing projects planned or discussed with the communities to create affordable housing. Blanket rezoning has nothing to do with affordable housing, it is a basically a verbal bandaid to a growing problem that is becoming increasingly visible in Ward 8 and other areas of the city.     Alternative strategies to support affordability would be to fix the drug crisis so that people aren’t afraid to share homes and residences, fearful of the drug crisis extending into their home. I don’t think we have a homelessness crisis I think we have a drug crisis. If we fix the drug crisis, treating homelessness will follow suit. Many people I know (including myself) work more than 1 or 2 jobs to make ends meet. If the city was more purposeful with their planning and spending, we could reduce taxes and this would directly improve affordability. This would leave more money in people’s pockets.    Further, with proper and responsible planning of affordable housing projects, you can create jobs, create support systems and increase the well being, survival and success of individuals who would otherwise not have the opportunity.

But it does take the burden off Council to review every individual R-CG application, freeing up time to address the broader issues facing our city, like affordability, infrastructure, and climate resilience. I believe our focus should now be on improving the implementation of rezoning with things like strengthening design standards, ensuring high-quality construction, and supporting infrastructure upgrades, rather than undoing it.",,No,,"While I understand that many residents value the contextual rules and public hearings tied to the previous system, returning to the old model would reintroduce unnecessary delays, inconsistencies, and costs for projects that meet established planning criteria. Before Council passed citywide rezoning for housing, almost all R-CG applications (94%) were being approved. Continuing to require individual hearings for those applications consumed significant time and resources without meaningfully improving outcomes.    Instead of reverting, I believe we should improve how the current system works: strengthen design standards, improve compliance enforcement, and provide tools to ensure infill integrates well with existing neighbourhoods. The goal should be to ensure new housing contributes positively to communities through proper guidelines and process, not to reinstate a case-by-case approval system that made our planning system less efficient, less equitable, and less trustworthy.",,No,,"I believe in open, transparent, and inclusive public engagement, but plebiscites are not the right tool for complex planning decisions. They tend to reduce nuanced issues into yes/no choices, which can overlook both the technical realities and the voices of those most affected by the housing crisis, including renters, newcomers, and people currently shut out of homeownership.    We elect City Councillors to make informed, city-wide decisions on complex issues, supported by expert planning staff, public input, and long-term strategic goals. Planning Calgary’s future should be based on evidence, community engagement, and equity, not campaigns that may favour the loudest or best-funded voices. That said, I fully support more robust engagement processes that bring residents into the conversation earlier, in clearer and more meaningful ways.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"I believe community involvement is essential — not to block growth, but to help shape it in ways that reflect shared values and improve quality of life. While I support citywide rezoning for housing as a necessary tool to address our housing crisis, it must be paired with strong, enforceable design standards, proactive communication, and clear accountability for how new developments integrate into existing neighbourhoods.    As someone who lives in a community that has seen significant R-CG development, I’ve experienced the difference between well-done development versus poorly-executed infill development. Communities should continue to have a role in influencing how growth takes place through Local Area Plans, design policies, and better enforcement during the building process, even if we no longer have our elected officials review every land use application one by one.",,,Undecided,"I support a careful and case-by-case review of which discretionary uses should become permitted uses.    In the case of rowhouses, I believe that making them permitted is a reasonable step, provided strong design guidelines are in place and enforced. These housing forms are already being widely approved and can help meet our city's need for more diverse and affordable options.    For supportive housing types like supportive transitionary housing, recovery residences or addiction treatment centres, I believe we need to approach reclassification carefully. These services play a vital role in addressing citywide challenges, and it is the responsibility of all Calgarians, not just residents in the inner city, to make space for them. At the same time, thoughtful integration matters. These uses should be situated where clients can access the wraparound supports they need, including transit, health care, and community services. Any move to reclassify should be guided by evidence, equity, and a clear plan to ensure they are successfully embedded into the urban fabric with transparency and accountability.",,,Undecided,"While it’s still early, Calgary is already seeing encouraging signs that citywide rezoning for housing and other strategy actions are helping expand supply and relieve pressure. According to the City’s July 2024 progress update:    - Calgary issued over 13,000 residential building permits in the first five months of the year, a record-setting pace and 30% higher than the same period in 2023.    - We’ve added over 20,000 net new housing units since the start of 2024, the highest rate per capita in Canada.    - Building permits for rowhouses and fourplexes more than doubled in established areas, many of which now allow these forms as-of-right due to rezoning.    - The average price of rowhouse units has decreased for the first time in years (from $499,000 in Q4 2023 to $472,000 in Q2 2024) showing early affordability improvements where gentle density is permitted.    While citywide rezoning for housing alone won’t solve the housing crisis, it removes key barriers to adding diverse housing forms and is helping to enable faster, more predictable development in areas with existing infrastructure. These outcomes support the broader affordability goals in the ""Home is Here"" housing strategy.",,,Undecided,"Citywide rezoning for housing when paired with strong regulation and accountability, is a tool for enabling more housing supply. Calgary’s R-CG zone permits gentle, ground-oriented housing like rowhouses and fourplexes, which are among the most cost-effective forms of housing to build. Data from the City’s housing strategy update shows that these forms are being delivered faster and, in some cases, at lower prices since zoning barriers were removed.    That said, concerns about speculation are valid. Not because of upzoning itself, but because of gaps in oversight and market regulation. To address this, I support:    - Exploring a vacant lot and unoccupied property tax to discourage speculative landholding.    - Strengthening developer accountability for on-site safety, cleanliness, and neighbourhood impact with things like snow shoveling of sidewalks.    - Tying growth to clear infrastructure investment and ensuring affordability through inclusionary tools, non-market housing support, and public land use.    Equitable development requires more than zoning reform, it requires smart follow-through and continuing to iterate on our guidelines and processes to ensure the best outcomes. That’s where I believe City Council must focus its attention next.",,,Undecided,"Displacement is a real concern in any fast-growing city. Not necessarily because of zoning changes themselves, but because we haven’t always had the right tools in place to manage redevelopment and protect affordability. That’s why I support citywide rezoning for housing as one part of a broader strategy that includes concrete actions to prevent displacement.    The ""Home is Here"" strategy outlines many of those tools, including stronger investments in non-market housing, support for community land trusts and co-ops, and tenant support measures. I also support exploring policies that discourage speculative flipping, incentivize affordability, and ensure that new development contributes to the livability and stability of existing communities, especially those where residents are more vulnerable to redevelopment pressure.    In my view, thoughtful growth must include policies that protect the people who have long called these neighbourhoods home, while also making room for those who need a home today.",,,Undecided,"While citywide rezoning is an important step toward more equitable and sustainable housing growth, I do not believe we’ve fully aligned it with the infrastructure investment needed to support it. Upzoning must go hand-in-hand with reinvestment in aging infrastructure, especially in established neighbourhoods where services like utilities, parks, transit, and schools are already under pressure.    To ensure we grow responsibly, I support:    - Scaling up capital investment in inner-city and mature areas, including roads, utility upgrades, and recreation facilities.    - Incorporating Infrastructure Capacity Reviews into the planning process to proactively assess where upgrades are needed.    - Tying growth to public service expansion through budget alignment, not just policy.    - Creating better tools for tracking infrastructure strain in real time, so we can adapt city services as density increases.    Growth must be accompanied by the resources to support it, otherwise we risk undermining the very communities we are trying to strengthen.",,,Undecided,"I support a phased and infrastructure-informed approach to growth. While we can’t afford to pause citywide densification given our current housing crisis, we do need to be smart about how and where it happens. In areas where infrastructure is clearly over capacity or public services are insufficient, the City should have the ability to sequence growth more thoughtfully.    That means:    - Tying new density to up-to-date infrastructure assessments    - Focus on development around city assets like transit and recreation areas to best utilize existing resources    - Requiring service readiness plans for larger redevelopments    - Prioritizing infrastructure reinvestment in established neighbourhoods that are already zoned for growth    Upzoning should not mean development without regard for capacity. Phased implementation, targeted investment, and real-time monitoring can help us avoid overloading communities while still making room for more housing.",Yes,,,"Infrastructure Capacity Reviews are a valuable tool for identifying where investment is needed and should inform how we support new growth. However, these reviews should guide planning and prioritization, not serve as a reason to pause or delay urgently needed housing. Calgary is in a housing crisis, and delaying new homes while waiting for “perfect” infrastructure conditions would only worsen affordability and push more people to the city’s outskirts, where servicing costs are higher and environmental impacts are greater.    Instead, we should pair Infrastructure Capacity Reviews with accelerated infrastructure reinvestment in established communities. This approach allows us to build smarter rather than slower, and makes room for more people while ensuring the systems they rely on are resilient and well-supported.",,,Undecided,"A reduced parking standard can work, when paired with investment in the things that make it possible for people to rely less on personal vehicles. That means improving public transit, building safe and connected bike infrastructure, supporting car share options, and making sure essential services are close to where people live.    A flat minimum like 0.5 stalls per unit might be appropriate in walkable, transit-rich areas, but it won’t work everywhere unless we make serious, sustained investments in alternatives to driving. The goal should be to give people real transportation choices, not just to cut parking arbitrarily. If we get that part right, we can build a city that’s more affordable, more sustainable, and more accessible, while also reducing the burden of costly parking infrastructure.",,,Undecided,"Mandating parking in every development drives up housing costs, limits design flexibility, and in areas with good transit access, walkable amenities, and specialty areas like student housing often creates more supply than demand.    Eliminating parking minimums doesn’t mean eliminating parking. It simply means letting developers, and ultimately the residents that chose to live there, decide what level of parking makes sense for a given project and location. This creates opportunities for more affordable and adaptable housing types, while encouraging smarter land use.    That said, to make this shift work the City must continue to improve transit, expand active transportation infrastructure, and support options like car share and bike storage. These are the kinds of investments that will allow us to build a city where not every home needs to come with a car, and where people have real freedom in how they get around.",,,Undecided,"Calgary already has one of the lowest urban tree canopies among major Canadian cities, and without better protections, increased lot coverage could make this worse. But the issue isn't necessarily citywide rezoning for housing and the solution isn't to halt new housing development. It’s to require better integration of trees and green space into how we build.    I support enforcing stronger tree-planting requirements on new builds and exploring creative approaches like building above garages to reduce lot coverage or modifying housing plans to keep mature trees. We should also be looking at how to use side yards, setbacks, and laneways more effectively for urban greening.    With thoughtful regulation and enforcement, we can grow our city and grow our canopy at the same time. This is not a zero-sum choice, it’s about good design and long-term planning.",,No,"Public greenspaces and parks are essential for community wellbeing, public health, and climate resilience. As we add more housing and welcome more people to our city, these shared spaces will only become more important, not less.    I do not support redeveloping existing parks or functional greenspaces into residential uses. Instead, I believe we need to invest in them, improve access to them, and expand them in both new and established communities. Growth should be paired with public realm improvements, not at their expense.",Yes,,,"Calgary’s tree canopy is a vital part of our urban infrastructure, and we need stronger policies to protect and grow it, especially on private land where most trees are currently located and where development poses the greatest risk.    I support requiring developers to work to retain trees, not just by planting new ones, but by getting more creative with how buildings are designed for and placed into their sites. Too often, entire lots are bulldozed by default. We need to shift that mindset and treat mature trees as assets to be incorporated, not obstacles to be cleared. That means clearer regulations, better incentives, and more flexibility in building envelopes to support preservation.    Urban trees contribute to cooling, stormwater management, air quality, and community character, and they must be a central part of how we grow.",Yes,,,"As Calgary grows, we need to protect and expand public greenspaces in every part of the city, not just to keep up with population growth, but to improve health, social connection, and climate resilience. Parks, playgrounds, and school fields are not luxuries, they are core infrastructure.    I support policies that prioritize access to greenspace as part of community planning and densification, and I would advocate for stronger requirements to integrate public realm improvements into new developments. This includes co-designing with communities and ensuring equitable greenspace access regardless of income or neighbourhood. A livable city needs more than homes, it needs places to gather, play, rest, and breathe.",,,Undecided,"We need more housing, but we also need it to be well-integrated into the communities where it’s built. Design matters. I support design standards that address key elements like building massing, privacy, landscaping, and how homes interact with the street.    As someone who lives in an area that has seen a lot of infill development, I’ve seen firsthand the difference between thoughtful, well-executed projects and those that disregard and degrade their context. We can welcome new neighbours while still protecting what people love about their communities, and good design is one of the most effective ways to do that.    This also means giving planning staff clear tools to hold builders to account, rather than relying solely on community opposition or costly appeals. Predictable, high-quality infill benefits everyone.",,,Undecided,"Protecting Calgary’s heritage isn’t about freezing neighbourhoods in time, but about ensuring that growth respects the unique features that give each community its character. That includes architectural elements, streetscapes, mature trees, and cultural landmarks that connect people to the history of where they live.    I support providing guidance for how new development can complement rather than erase the qualities that define our older neighbourhoods. We also need to strengthen incentives for heritage preservation and adaptive reuse, turning older buildings into housing, businesses, or community spaces without losing their historic value. Growth and heritage can work together.",,,Undecided,"A thoughtful, flexible approach to planning is essential to ensuring that new housing supports livability, equity, and long-term sustainability. That means aligning growth with existing infrastructure and public services, respecting local context through design standards, and creating meaningful opportunities for community input throughout the process.    It also means prioritizing transit-oriented development, especially in areas already well-served by frequent transit. Building more homes near transit helps reduce car dependence, lower emissions, and increase affordability by reducing transportation costs for residents. When combined with walkability, mixed uses, and good urban design, transit-oriented development helps deliver vibrant, connected communities that meet both current and future needs.    Flexibility should not mean inconsistency, it should mean smarter planning that allows us to build a more inclusive and resilient Calgary.",,No,,"I do not support pausing or restarting the Local Area Plans (LAPs) that have already been approved. These plans were developed through extensive engagement, including with community associations, residents, and local stakeholders. While no process is perfect, many Calgarians contributed their time and input in good faith, and we need to honour that effort.    That said, I support improving future engagement processes to ensure they are more accessible, transparent, and inclusive, especially for renters, youth, newcomers, and others whose voices have traditionally been underrepresented in planning conversations. Engagement should be ongoing, not just tied to one moment in a plan’s creation.    Local Area Plans are a valuable tool for coordinating change in a way that reflects community priorities and citywide goals. We should focus on making them stronger and more responsive, not throwing them out.",,No,,"I live in Banff Trail, a neighbourhood that had a restrictive covenant placed on it when my home was built in 1956. At the time, the area was on the edge of the city and overlooked open fields and the mountains. Since then, everything around us has changed: major institutions like the university and hospitals have been built, and there’s now a CTrain station just a few blocks from my door.    It simply doesn’t make sense to freeze a neighbourhood in time using private legal tools created under a completely different set of circumstances. Our city is a place of growth and transformation, and our planning tools need to reflect that. Zoning decisions should be made through a public, transparent process that considers citywide needs, equity, and sustainability, not through decades-old covenants that restrict change and limit housing choice.",,No,,"Direct Control zoning allows the City to respond to unique or complex situations, including cases where a restrictive covenant is blocking appropriate development that aligns with modern planning goals. These tools should be used carefully and transparently, but they are essential when outdated or exclusionary covenants stand in the way of creating housing, complete communities, or public benefit.

Alternative strategies to support affordability would be to fix the drug crisis so that people aren’t afraid to share homes and residences, fearful of the drug crisis extending into their home.

0,,No,,"Trust & Transparency on Blanket Rezoning  The City of Calgary spent months and significant resources on public engagement for blanket rezoning. Thousands of Calgarians participated, and the clear majority of submissions were opposed.   Despite that, Council declined to hold a plebiscite—  an option that would have provided a definitive, citywide vote on a policy affecting every community.  During this period, the City also retained an external consultant specializing in urban density who later resigned shortly after the measure passed. Subsequent FOIP requests for details of that contract   were denied or heavily redacted.   Taken together, these choices have damaged public trust and created the perception that the outcome was predetermined and that federal grant funding was driving the decision regardless of local feedback.  This should not happen again. When a proposal affects the whole city and strong majority opposition is evident, Council must exercise restraint and ensure the public’s will is meaningfully reflected in the decision.",Yes,,,,Yes,,,"Calgary’s growth should respect the character of established neighbourhoods while allowing sensible, case-by-case redevelopment.

In my view, declining a plebiscite on a city-shaping decision undermined public trust and left many residents feeling unheard.

0,,No,,"Blanket rezoning across the city doesn't work and creates serious secondary problems.  I am not against rezoning—I am against doing it without proper planning. The city is growing. This is not to stop it, but to support it properly.    We need better strategic sequencing and planning. Many areas were never designed for high density. If density is to increase, it must be supported by long-term planning over the next decade to ensure infrastructure can handle growth, traffic is managed, transit improves, and communities become economically self-sufficient enough to weather downturns.    We must also consider the human element. Do we have adequate public spaces, seniors' facilities, childcare, and healthcare to reduce hospital pressure? Are there commercial units that lower business overhead while providing residents easy access to groceries and services? What are the impacts on trees, parks, recreation, and schools?    Community identity matters. Calgary's neighborhoods each have distinct architectural character that reflects our culture and unity that grounds us. That identity must be preserved and continued in new development.    We also have the expertise. Calgary has urban planners, engineers, and support workers with the training to do this properly. We also have centuries of global examples that show what works and what fails. Yet blanket rezoning ignored these resources and failed to ask: what caused this housing crisis, and are those offering funding—which we must repay—also the ones who created the problem? There is no such thing as free Federal funding. It's a loan taken out on behalf of you and your children, so such arrangements must be scrutinized and mayors kept in check.    I have seen these issues firsthand in the United Kingdom—housing initiatives that were politically driven rather than community-focused, with wide-ranging negative implications.    Finally, we need better governance. For over a decade, we've lacked elected officials with broad business, finance, risk management, and international governance experience. Council needs representatives who can ask better questions and draw on wider reference points.    We can achieve smart rezoning with strategic planning—building communities that are economically viable, resilient, and capable of delivering long-term housing solutions.

Municipalities bear the pressures but don't control the sources.    However, the City has some tools to navigate this through better planning by creating self-sustaining neighborhoods that serve as commercial economic hubs, managed and driven by local residents. Mixed-use design with road & transit-oriented development combines residential and business districts, reducing overhead costs for businesses and transportation costs for families—an approach that has been proven successful worldwide.    Speculation is always a factor in real estate and thats not going away. Blanket upzoning may risk driving it further. At the same time, without proper planning, it does not guarantee affordability or livable communities.    The key is not just land-use change, but the strategy around services—transit, schools, healthcare access, and local commerce. If these are integrated with housing growth, development can support families and create stability. Without them, blanket rezoning risks benefitting speculators more than residents.

Only when the situation became critical and the political climate became convenient did investment arrive—they came as saviors, framing it as their bastion of political success.    Road networks were deliberately reduced to create congestion. A congestion charge zone was introduced forcing residents, and seniors on fixed incomes to sell their perfectly running vehicles and spend money on newer vehicles. The impact on commercial vehicles drove prices up as costs were passed on. Bike lanes were introduced where none were needed, and millions were spent on express bus network that already existed. The express bus network was just rebranded, thus allowing unknowns to pocket taxpayers' money without delivering real improvements.    It's not just about blanket rezoning. The knock-on effects are serious.    The lesson is clear: investment is always necessary, but HOW it's planned matters. Without strategic planning that includes infrastructure, commercial and local services, the redevelopment risks displacement and political money laundering through wasted spending.     This is why it's important to elect a city councillor like myself with a range of sector and lived experiences to identify these issues, stop the nonsense and to work on pragmatic solutions.

0,Yes,,,"I voted yes to the bylaw; however my support resulted in the passing of my amendments to the R-CG zoning that addressed concerns around parking minimums and density calculations, reducing the negative impacts for established communities in Ward 2. I also wrote a statement which is posted below.     May 17, 2024  First, I want to thank everyone who shared their valuable insights, concerns, and opinions on the  changes to the zoning bylaw. We all have deep, emotional connections to our homes and community,  and any discussion about potential impacts on those connections can be fraught. In the weeks leading up  to the public hearing, I took the opportunity to connect directly with citizens and engaged in numerous  30-minute to 1-hour phone calls with all Ward 2 constituents who contacted my office and were open to  speaking with me about this important issue. I wanted to ensure I had a holistic understanding of the  issues and concerns of Ward 2 residents, as this is a widespread and complex topic that would affect  everyone differently. I listened intently, took in valuable feedback from each conversation, and brought  forward thoughtful amendments which were supported by Council.  This was a difficult decision. The majority of Ward 2 (north of Stoney) is already built as R-G zoned  communities (single-family, duplexes, rowhouses), and all our Ward 2 communities were built with a  plan that balances low-density options available under R-CG. Every Ward 2 community has a diverse  mix of rowhomes, duplexes, and single-family homes. The vast majority of our communities are built  with a street design that maximizes the greatest and best use. This makes it challenging to increase  density because we are not built in a grid street design with rectangle lots that are 50’ x 120’. In the end,  this change to R-CG has minimal if any impact on Ward 2. This is an inner-city solution to an inner-city  problem and where redevelopment is already occurring.  Many people expressed valid concerns about the impacts of increased density, including the number of  allowable units, higher population, traffic, and parking requirements. I worked with Administration and  Council colleagues on both sides of the issue to develop two thoughtful amendments I introduced to  address those concerns.  Amendment 1: Secondary suites and carriage homes are to be included in the unit calculation.  This has been a great frustration of mine since joining office. The density in Ward 2 is higher than that  of all wards except Ward 8 and Ward 5. The city is turning into a density donut, where our outer  communities have a higher density of homes and population than post-war suburbs. One issue which  greatly impacts the level of services (i.e. transit) an area receives is density calculations. Secondary  suites are not included as living units in density calculations and need to be reflected in the true density  calculations of an area. Ward 2 already absorbs a substantial portion of the city’s density without  receiving more services in return. Communities like Evanston, with a high growth rate in secondary  suites and potential renters, have not received increased City services to reflect that growth. With this  amendment, that will soon change. Separate living units will all be counted in the density calculations.  This will also increase parking requirements, as they are calculated on a per-unit basis.  Amendment 2: Tiered parking requirements based on age of community.  The theory behind having no parking requirements is that if people do not have a place to park a car,  they will instead take transit. Transit infrastructure is not equitable across the city, and unfortunately, the  Route Ahead Strategy is aiming to make it less so. The City’s re-zoning changes under R-CG proposed  that developments required 0.5 parking stalls per unit. It is not practical, nor does it make sense to have  0.5 parking stalls per unit in outer communities that have poor transit service. Inner-city communities  have significantly better transit services and are better suited for a minimum of 0.5 parking spaces per  unit. As such, my amendment requires communities built post-1970s to have a minimum of 1 parking  spot per unit, and those pre-1960s remain with 0.5 spots per unit. (This map shows communities by age.)  This was supported by Council with a 12-2 vote.  Market Impact:  Given our proximity in Ward 2 to greenfield development, there is little to no market support for large  infills in Ward 2. With the high cost of developed properties in Ward 2, it does not make economic  sense for developers or property owners to do infill projects in Ward 2. The potential profit margins are  not there and will not be for many years. Additionally, older communities in Ward 2 already have  rowhomes and duplexes available in material quantities, which sell for a market price below the current  costs to build a similar unit. The market factors and additional unit and parking considerations from the  amendments I brought forward will drive development into older inner-city communities closer to  transit and the downtown with a grid street design, or to our greenfield developments.  Campaign Platform:  I ran on a platform stating that I would make difficult decisions in the best interest of our community.  This was one of those decisions. The media and political partisans are taking advantage of general and  warranted frustrations in our politicians, the economy, and the cost of living to make this a lightning rod  issue. In reality, this is not a very impactful piece of legislation. The biggest benefit is removing one of  many red tape layers in redeveloping low-density dwellings. Public appeal processes at the development  permit stage still exist, current owners will benefit from a slight land lift in the value of their homes. The  result isn't what I had envisioned, but it represents a positive step forward.  My Continued Commitment to Ward 2 Residents:  My office is always open, available, and accessible. I will personally have a conversation with you about  any concerns that may arise. Should there be a proposed development in your community that worries  you, I pledge to advocate for necessary amendments and facilitate dialogue between all involved parties  to reach mutually beneficial solutions.  Again, thank you to everyone who reached out to my office, to those who took the time to come to the  public hearing, and to those I was able to have conversations with. I truly appreciate your insights, I too  love this city and our community, and want to make sure Calgary remains a city where everyone can  thrive and prosper under our Calgary advantage.  ",,,Undecided,"Repealing the bylaw has a potential financial impact, as it removes a right. The removal of rights creates a situation where those who want to maintain their zoning can sue for the loss of value. The way forward is to create an opt in to single family zoning. This will allow property owners who want to revert their property back to the previous zoning will submit an administrative request to revert back to the previous zoning.     Another issue to address is the Calgary Plan where Zoning definitions are going to change again. I have concerns with the Calgary Plan that will need to be addressed which is why I put the motion before council that sent the Calgary Plan back to Administration.   ",,,Undecided," I think we need to reevaluate zoning definitions, we need to differentiate between the definitions of the inner city and greenfield development. We need to create better set back, permeable surface expectations,  design expectations, etc.   The best way forward is to evaluate community needs and challenges based off of the past few years. We are seeing changes in the housing market, with slower sales, lower prices, higher inventory, and lower rents. ",,,Undecided,"Plebiscites are a way for elected officials to defer working with communities, experts and building channels of communication where all parties can share ideas and come to decisions of the highest utility for our communities. Plebiscites are non-binding, expensive, divisive, and lack details and nuances that form thoughtful decisions. The results are non binding and politicians do not always follow or support the results in subsequent votes. An example of the challenges of plebiscites is all the Fluoride Plebiscite votes and the most recent in 2021. Calgarians were able to vote whether they wanted to add fluoride to our water, and they voted in favour, but not all councillor voted in line with the democratic will of the people. There are too many questions that need answering, do all homeowners get a vote even if they are ineligible voters? Will politicians honour the results? Will the council just push through the Calgary Plan with higher and more intrusive zoning regulations? An issue not likely included in the plebiscite question. What happens when Calgarians call for a different outcome in the years following the plebiscite. When the question was before council I was supportive, now I want to discuss with Calgarians their expectations and answer the questions I have.

I believe we need a more flexible and adaptable land use bylaw that allows for the development of a range of different housing choices.",,No,,I do not believe that a plebiscite is a good use of taxpayer dollars. A plebiscite is expensive and non-binding. I strongly believe that this is the purview of an elected council in a representative democracy system.

I strongly believe that local input to planning efforts such as Local Area Plans is critical to ensuring the success of any such efforts. I also believe that the city-wide upzoning allowed for modest increases in density to occur city-wide as opposed to exclusively in a small number of neighbourhoods.    As a city, we need to continue to evaluate how we grow, how we can equitably distribute and share services, infrastructure, and space. I do not believe that any single group, organization, or individual should have the power to single-handedly control or manipulate planning decisions. Rather, it needs to be approached equitably, with input from many different voices and demographics. This includes considerations for future generations of Calgarians.     That said, I do believe that politics, including around city planning, have become increasingly polarizing. I commit to working with communities and incorporating input from a wide array of voices in my decision-making process. I aim to create a collaborative ward office and to help create a collaborative decision-making process.",Yes,,,"I strongly believe that we need to have a more flexible land use bylaw. It has long been identified that the centralized model for health and social supports puts undue pressure on single communities due to the oversubscription of services. A distributed model, where supports can be local and better incorporated into communities is much more effective - we should be aiming to work collaboratively to make this happen.    My office will ensure that this does not remove the input from the wide array of community members and voices. I commit to holding proponents accountable for early and meaningful engagement so that input can be best reflected in the final product, regardless of the type of housing. A variety of housing types and residents ultimately makes the fabric of the community stronger.",Yes,,,"Though it’s still rather early to confirm the level of success, we have seen a decrease in rental prices (https://calgary.citynews.ca/2025/08/09/calgary-rent-prices-continue-downward-spiral-report/), likely in-part, due to an increase of supply in the purpose-built rental market. Additionally, Calgary has seen relatively low purchasing price increases (https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/calgary-home-prices-fall-in-july-as-supply-returns-to-pre-covid-levels/ar-AA1JMQwr?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds), with some projections predicting a long-term slight decrease in costs (https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-home-prices-could-dip-100000-in-two-years-study-says). This has been widely attributed to the building patterns in Alberta, which have been commended across the country.    This combination of metrics suggests that changes in building patterns have been effective in improving housing affordability, though much more work still needs to be done, particularly through major increases to Calgary’s non-market housing stock.",,No,,"Again, I believe this is more complex than a simple yes-no answer. Real estate speculation is an issue regardless of whether the base residential zone is R-CG or not. Speculation has played a role in the housing crisis that we now find ourselves in, and this is due to more than just zoning.    I do strongly believe that we need to look at progressive taxation alternatives, especially on vacant or unused properties to help reduce speculation. Property tax amendments could help to promote the conversion of vacant houses and plots to usable housing, again helping to deliver affordability. ",,No,,"Once again, I believe that this is a pressing issue that was occurring prior to the rezoning, and will continue unless we work to address the root cause of the issue - a lack of affordable housing. The rapidly increasing cost of housing was already resulting in increasing rents and displacement of lower-income residents.    There are many variables that contribute to affordability and the ability for people to age-in-place. The opportunity to have a variety of housing choices and types actually will help to support community members staying in the neighbourhood of their choice, even through life changes, aging, etc.     Calgary has some of the lowest affordable housing stock of major Canadian cities. I strongly support generational investments into building non-market housing, such as nonprofit housing and housing cooperatives, be it through city land transfers or direct financial support. ",,,Undecided,"I believe that the physical infrastructure for core services such as water, wastewater, etc. are well covered and included in the permitting process. Every development does require a Development Site Servicing Report which identifies if the existing infrastructure is of an appropriate capacity for the proposed development.    I do believe that the City needs to do a better job of bringing in supporting public services and programming, be it transit, recreation facilities, or mobility infrastructure. Currently, our inner-city communities are seeing an attrition in these services while our population increases - a trend that needs to be addressed. I am a strong proponent that public services need to be brought in early in the growth process as opposed to playing catch-up after population growth has occurred.     Allowing incremental growth actually helps to promote and support more stable public services due to an increased user base and demand. This is a net benefit for communities that will see investments in infrastructure and public services. Gentle density is one of the best ways to reduce our infrastructure deficit and to invest in the networks of infrastructure required to keep our city operating. Ultimately, having a financially sustainable city is critical to keeping Calgary affordable as any raises in taxes disproportionately impacts lower-income Calgarians.",,No,,"Once again, I don’t believe a simple yes-no captures the nuance of this discussion. As previously mentioned, I’m a strong proponent of services coming in tandem with density. We need to invest in our communities where growth is occurring. We need to see improved recreation options, pathways; we need investments into our inner city communities. ",Yes,,,"I do believe that development should require an assessment of the impact of new developments on residents. However, many of these endpoints are already considered as a part of the Development Site Servicing Plan requirements.     I also am an advocate of having improved communication between other parties impacted by Calgary’s growth patterns. This includes school boards, the province, and internal City of Calgary departments such as parks. For some of these metrics, including recreation, work has been done through the local area planning process or is ongoing through different efforts. These are important aspects of community growth that need to be addressed.",Yes,,,"I strongly believe that a parking minimum is just that, a minimum. So long as there is demand for parking above the required 0.5 stalls per unit, additional parking will be incorporated into developments; otherwise, units won’t sell. The majority of developments will include more than the minimum given current demands.    I do strongly believe that we also need to improve alternatives to personal car ownership, such as transit and cycling infrastructure, to help make this minimum parking stall ratio more attainable.",Yes,,,"Again, removing parking requirements is not the same as banning parking out right. Residential developers will provide the number of parking stalls that market demands. People who need more parking than is available on site or on the street won’t choose to live there. I adamantly believe that we need to offer better alternatives as identified in the previous question. However, at the core of it, I believe that homes for people are more important than homes for cars.",,No,,"I believe that existing bylaws intended to preserve tree canopy, when development is taking place, must be enforced. While I acknowledge that there is a modest increase in lot coverage size, the retention of private trees falls to the individual property owner. The retention of private trees isn’t tied to the base residential zone. I am a strong advocate of improving our tree canopy wherever feasible. This will require council, developers, and community to meaningfully work together to improve the protection of existing trees and the planting of new trees throughout the development process.",,No,"While I believe that we should protect existing greenspaces wherever possible, it is important to distinguish between the types and utilization patterns of greenspaces. Protecting and incorporating greenspaces in and around new developments is important for livability. However, the current utilization and type of greenspace should also be weighted in those decisions, as should if there are available land swaps or other ways to help retain the same overall amount of greenspace.",Yes,,,"I believe that there could be a way to incentivize the retention of trees on personal property, through subsidies or incentives when redeveloping properties. However, this also has to be weighed with the role of personal property rights.",Yes,,,"In addition to protecting and expanding greenspaces where possible, we should also be identifying ways to better utilize and connect these green spaces to communities. This includes improving infrastructure and access, such as transit and sidewalks, to existing spaces. ",,No,,"The exception to my “no” response is where Heritage Guideline Areas are identified in Local Area Plans. I believe that it is incredibly difficult to define a specific community character that could be captured in new developments. Accordingly, I believe it would be incredibly difficult to dictate exactly what type and style of building should be built in a community. I strongly believe a diversity of housing, including heritage buildings, is important to creating a vibrant community.     That said, I do believe that the development of standardized design guidelines can help to streamline the approvals process and help us address the housing crisis while also providing a number of “off-the-shelf” designs that can integrate well with the community. I believe the City of Calgary could build on any efforts being undertaken by the federal government to better incorporate local context. This is similar to what Edmonton has been exploring.",,No,,"I do believe that areas in Local Area Plans identified as “heritage guideline areas” should be respected. Beyond that, I’m not entirely sure what is being asked by this question.

I also believe that early engagement between development applicants and community members can proactively raise the importance of specific architectural styles and designs.

All the pieces outlined in the question are important; however, how they get evaluated and what is identified as a success will likely be different based on different individuals and organizations.

0,Yes,,,"I do not agree with the WEF (World Economic Forum) and their statement, ""You will own nothing and be happy."" In most cases, people would agree that less bureaucracy is a good thing. Although not perfect, the bylaws intent was to build more houses helping with the current short fall and give the working class, their kids and grandkids a place to get into a home. Thus ensuring them a starting place to secure their financial independence, just as those who currently own in these neighbourhoods did 20-30 years ago. The general idea by some, that this rezoning will just be a free for all, is at best, misinformed and at worst a blatant lie or scare tactic to induce fear. The truth is, that there have already been several amendments made to the current bylaw to address parking, green spaces, as well as height of the buildings (example R-CG zoning allows heights of 11 meters, basically 2 stories.) I in no way see this bylaw as perfect and I fully empathize with all the current owners in these neighbourhoods who are witnessing their areas change. But this bylaw doesn't allow unrestricted development. Developers must adhere to permit processes and specific design guidelines to ensure new builds fit into the community. Also, community feed back has not been closed, there will still be meetings for public discourse during the development process. What I want to stress is that there is a difference between what ""can"" happen and what ""will"" happen. As your own website states, on your 3 major issues, these concerns ""can"" happen. What I propose to you, is by doing nothing what the WEF said ""will"" happen and our kids and grandkids will be worse off for it.",,No,,"Most of the candidates that have shown support for the ""repeal"" all say the same thing.

There is no law saying we can't take the time and see what this looks like in two years, by May 2026. Has it accomplished what we thought it would?

I see both sides. I fully understand why every Calgarian should be heard an equal weight in the game. However, we don't live in a ""direct"" democracy, we live in a ""representative"" democracy. Scale matters. Basically, if we had a ""direct"" democracy how would we decide what is a significant law or bylaw that needs to be voted on? What's significant to one person may not be to another. Many policy decisions are highly complex, requiring in-depth knowledge, research, and understanding of interconnected systems. We can't expect every citizen to become an expert in every system. This breeds confusion and misinformation. Take for instance sewage and water, how many constituents understand gravity and engineering, capacity, cost and coordination and how it connects to our larger system. It's a balance, that's what democracy truly is.

It also doesn't stop community input or hearings. We can look at this policy in a couple years and see its outcome. Did it address the “missing middle”, has working class home ownership gone up? If not, then we can adjust and amend policy. But moving forward with the statis quo before the rezoning, was only increasing the disparity between home ownership and forever renters. Between 2020 and 2023 alone, Calgary experienced a 40% increase in rents and a 37% increase in prices for single-detached homes.

Communities know what makes sense for them. ",Yes,,,"This is what we are seeing with the current blanket rezoning. Blanket rezoning does not create affordability, nor does it meet the demand for housing. This is not a solution for affordability. The tax freeze I have proposed will give Calgarians certainty on their tax bills for the next four years.",Yes,,,"Again, this comes down to a bogged-down planning department that is driving away investment and causing our city to fall behind with housing developments that can better address affordable housing for Calgarians. We need these solutions for our neighbours in need and I will work with communities to make this happen together. Calgarians are struggling to keep up with cost pressures. We are seeing many seniors no longer able to age in place due to rising property values and taxes.

Blanket rezoning is not about creating affordability, it has failed to keep the character and affordability of communities intact.  ",,No,,"Blanket rezoning has resulted in significant impacts to existing communities, from pressure on water/sewer pipes to parking impacts.  The city has not adequately planned for sewer, water, or road infrastructure that keeps pace with development pressures.  It's why we are seeing businesses in Marda Loop closing their doors.  It's why we see Beltline businesses struggling.  It's why citizens are suing the city.  We should be prioritizing density where density belongs and ensuring local infrastructure is equipped to handle added pressures or that infrastructure is built in advance to support development. As the next Mayor, I will focus on repairing our broken water lines and fixing our roads to ensure the basic infrastructure is working for you.",Yes,,,"Calgarians do not need to worry about whether or not they can turn on the taps or have a shower. We are driving around on roads, where 40% are in disrepair. This is unacceptable and the result of a City Council too busy fighting over ideology, rather than taking care of essential services. We need to ensure our infrastructure is up to par before we approve community densification. ",Yes,,,"Had due diligence of maintaining our existing infrastructure been taking place, the water pipe crisis of 2024 could have been averted. I support checks and balances of our infrastructure and will ensure the roads and pipes are built before the homes. ",,No,,The bigger problem is that administration uses discretion to choose when and where they apply the parking rule.  We must ensure that parking no longer causes neighbours to battle with neighbours. Calgarians have an expectation that they get from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time. This could be from walking to driving and everything in between. Assuming such a low number of cars doesn’t reflect they reality and simple pits neighbours against one another. Real solutions are fact-based and honest.,,No,,"Like it or not, Calgary is a driving city, with nine months of hockey and three months of bad ice, and we must ensure parking requirements meet the expectations of citizens.

I would suggest partnerships with private land owners over legislative solutions. ,Yes,,,"Our greenspaces are what set us apart from other cities around the world. It's essential that we ensure our communities have ample community and green spaces. As I mentioned previously, when you lose a green space it never comes back.

This is best done through meaningful and codified consultation.",Yes,,,"Restrictive covenants are not open to interpretation, unless the will of the community brings it forward. Planning and development should never have been about pitting neighbours against one another. ",Yes,,,"Yes, unless community consultation has created alignment with the request.

We support halfway houses and addiction treatment centres and recognise the many factors involved in their planning and location. Building a strong partnership with the province is a top priority, and my experience with the Ministry of Community and Social Services will help us accomplish this.    With respect to rowhouses, prior to blanket rezoning they were permitted in areas of the city where their presence was appropriate, such as along main streets and in proximity to transit. We are in favour of maintaining rowhouses as a permitted use in these locations, and note that permitted status continues to allow for appeals to the SDAB.

The budget approval resulted in a 3.6% increase in property taxes collected by the City, with an average 5.5% increase for homeowners across Calgary. The budget reports did not provide enough detail to confirm the prioritization of infrastructure projects and front-line services.    During the budget process, she proposed or supported several amendments intended to reduce this impact. These included:    ● Reducing senior leadership spending: Proposals to cut discretionary travel and entertainment budgets and reduce the Executive Leadership office budget were rejected by Council.

And one concern I have is parking. Where are people going to park?    I’ll be there to represent you as a Calgarian. They targeted your promises by allowing outsiders to circumvent key protections for your home and your safety. It started with the bylaws and our values. Now they are attacking the way we live. Soon, safety will erode, children will not be safe on the street, and people will start losing their jobs.    This is an economic crisis waiting to happen. I’ve seen the issues in big cities — and we can learn from them. But this is Calgary. We can’t just copy what others do. We must study them scientifically and test our hypotheses before implementing new ideas.    My promise to you is this: they won’t get away with it again. This is our last chance. Once we lose community protections, they will be gone forever. I need your support to protect and to rebuild the trust that we Calgarians deserve. And to support me, I need leaders to help me. A leader moves others to action. And the best way to move others to action is by sharing vision. The vision is simple:    Our neighbourhoods can be clean, safe, quality, beautiful home where you can grow old. Where taxes don’t punish elders.

Affordability is about how much someone can afford — and that comes down to their income.    This whole narrative has been set up to mislead people. This is how they do business: contribute to a problem, like the economic crisis, and then blame someone else.    Calgarians must demand higher wages or upgrade skills. Otherwise, we will end up like Toronto or Vancouver. And ask yourself honestly: would you walk alone in a dark alley in Vancouver at night?    The politicians don’t care about you.

Seniors being forced out of their homes after decades because City Hall’s policies made them a target. Families unable to start because rents are too high. Children left homeless or unsafe because their parents have no place to live.

0,,No,,"From John Pantazopoulos:     No. I was one of hundreds of Calgarians (and the only official Ward 6 candidate) who spoke at City Hall to say this wasn’t the right approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fZo4TPut84&t=35681s.     Council went ahead anyway, and that’s part of why people feel unheard.    I’m not against adding more housing. We need it as our City continues to grow.  However, a one-size-fits-all policy that treats every street and community the same does not deliver good outcomes. It lets lots flip to eight-plexes overnight without thinking about whether the schools have room, whether the roads are already jammed, whether the water and sewer systems can handle the additional load or whether the design fits the neighbourhood. That’s not smart growth.    I’d rather see density where it works best: along CTrain lines, near services and amenities, in areas that actually build up communities and where adequate infrastructure exists to manage the incremental growth. That’s how you get both more housing, stronger neighbourhoods and development that makes financial sense.  ",Yes,,,"Repealing blanket rezoning will be one of my first priorities. Everywhere I go in Ward 6, people tell me the same thing: this needs to be reversed. I hear them loud and clear.    I’ll work with other councillors to bring this bylaw back to the table and undo it. Calgarians want a better path forward, and that starts with restoring some trust by admitting this was the wrong approach.  ",Yes,,,"Yes, at least in the short term.     The old rules were not perfect, but they gave Calgarians a chance to weigh in on proposals and have their voices heard. Planning is also a major responsibility of City Council and we need to take that responsibility seriously. Blanket rezoning stripped that away and is not acceptable.    As a business owner, I know red tape and consultation can cause delays, but cutting the community out entirely is not the answer.     We need a planning system that balances efficiency with real consultation for residents. Restoring the old system gives us breathing room while we design something better.     We need a system that’s transparent, outcome-focused, and actually improves neighbourhoods instead of creating conflict.  ",,,Undecided,"The best plebiscite is already happening: this election. Calgarians now have a chance to elect councillors who will repeal blanket rezoning. I’m not against plebiscites in extreme cases, but they should be the last resort.     The real answer is electing councillors who actually listen and act on what residents are saying.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Communities need a real say and need to be meaningfully engaged.    Calgary’s growing fast, and we do need more homes. But each neighbourhood is different. What fits in Currie Barracks may not fit in Wildwood. Good planning respects those differences and makes sure new housing actually works with what’s already there.    If City Hall pushes density at all costs without consultation, it backfires. People dig in, trust erodes, and we end up with bad outcomes. If we bring residents into the process, we can grow in ways that keep communities strong and give families confidence in the future of their neighbourhood.  ",,No,,"There’s a reason we have discretionary uses. Things like halfway houses or addiction treatment centres can be necessary, but where they go matters a lot to the people who live nearby and will be impacted the most.     Taking away hearings and appeal rights means communities lose their voice on projects that can change the feel of a neighbourhood overnight.    Now, I’m not against streamlining where it makes sense. For example, city council recently cut red tape on rowhouses in brand-new suburbs, and that’s fine — those areas are planned for it. But the impacts are bigger in established communities and neighbours deserve to be heard.  ",,No,,"Not to my eye, and that’s the problem.    We were told blanket rezoning would make housing more affordable. But what we’re seeing are expensive townhomes and multi-plexes. Replacing an $800,000 home with a $1.6 million duplex does not help a young family or a senior on a fixed income. It just changes the form, not the price.    If the goal is affordability, then let’s be honest… there’s no evidence this policy has delivered.",Yes,,,"I’ve already heard from residents of Ward 6 worried about investors circling their streets. In Glendale, I saw a mailbox with a note that read: “No real estate promotions. We do not support rezoning. This house is not for sale.” That says a lot.    And, further to the last question, the new builds often aren’t starter homes — they’re high-end multiplexes. That’s not what most Calgarians were asking for.",Yes,,,"Absolutely. In fact, I know it’s already happening in communities such as Wildwood and Spruce Cliff in Ward 6. Long-time residents are getting pushed out of their neighbourhood as high-density developments, like eight-plexes, are going up.     Growth shouldn’t mean pushing people out. To me, progress is when we add housing and keep our communities intact.     That’s why I want a more careful, inclusive approach — one that builds new homes while protecting existing residents.  ",,No,,"Council approved blanket rezoning without a plan to fund the extra roads, sewers, schools (with the province), or parks that more people will need.    Look at the warning signs: last summer’s water main break in Bowness showed how fragile some of our infrastructure is.     In Ward 6, for instance, Griffith Woods School is already bursting at 112% capacity. Roads in places like Signal Hill are packed at rush hour. Yet the City still went ahead as if everything could absorb more people with no upgrades. That’s not realistic.  ",Yes,,,"It’s just common sense that we shouldn’t force densification into areas that don’t have the infrastructure or services to support more people – at least not without addressing those gaps first.    If a neighbourhood’s school is already full, or the sewer lines are at capacity, we shouldn’t force more density until those issues are fixed. Growth should match what the infrastructure can handle.    My approach would be “infrastructure first.” Target growth where services can support it, pause in areas that can’t, and invest in upgrades before we load more demand onto already strained systems.  ",Yes,,,"Infrastructure Capacity Reviews make sense.    Before approving big density changes, we should ask: can the water and sewer handle it? Do we have enough park space? Is the school already full? If the answer is no, then upgrades need to be part of the plan before a shovel hits the ground.    That’s just responsible planning. In business, you don’t scale up before you know the systems can handle it. City Hall should use the same logic.  ",,No,,"Half a stall per home might work downtown where transit is more readily available, but it doesn’t match how most Calgarians live today.     Families in Ward 6 often need one or two vehicles. If we cut parking that low everywhere, it just pushes cars onto already crowded streets and I’ve already heard parking issues in Ward 6 in places such as Christie Park.    I support adjusting rules based on location. Near CTrain stations, maybe less parking works. But in suburban communities, we need more realistic standards. Otherwise, you’re creating headaches for residents before they even move in.  ",,No,,"No, not city-wide. I’ve talked to families and seniors who are worried about losing parking, and they’re right. Not everyone can bike to work or haul groceries on the CTrain.    Where transit is strong, like downtown, we can be flexible. But in most neighbourhoods, removing all requirements doesn’t make sense yet. We need to find a balanced approach.",Yes,,,"Bigger building footprints mean less room for yards and mature trees. When older homes are torn down for multiplexes, the trees are usually the first to go.    Calgary already needs more greenery, not less. Trees cool our streets, clean our air, and give neighbourhoods character. If we lose them to blanket upzoning, we’re taking a step backward.  ",,No,"Every great city protects its parks.    Our city is growing, but bulldozing fields and playgrounds for housing is short-sighted. Parks are where kids play soccer, where families gather, where people walk their dogs. They’re essential, not extras.    If we need more land, let’s look at under-used commercial sites or light industrial first. For instance, West Springs has an old radio tower site and that’s a good place for redevelopment (residential or for a community association building.) But not our parks.  ",Yes,,,"A big chunk of Calgary’s tree canopy is in front and back yards. If we don’t protect it, we’ll lose it lot by lot. I’d support policies that encourage people to keep healthy trees and plant new ones.",Yes,,,"Absolutely. Parks, playgrounds, and school fields are part of what makes Calgary a great city to raise a family. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.    In older communities, we should hold on to every bit of green space we’ve got. In new communities, we need to make sure enough land is set aside from the start. I’ll always back policies that protect and grow our parks system.  ",,,Undecided,"The Municipal Development Plan promotes infills that are “sensitive, compatible and complementary to the existing, physical patterns and character of neighbourhoods”. That principle is sound.    Where we need balance is in how we apply it. On one hand, residents rightly expect that new developments will fit with the scale and character of their streets.     On the other, we should be careful not to add so much red tape that we make it impossible to build good housing or discourage investment in established communities. Everyone has a different taste on what qualifies as good design and we need to be mindful of that.     The goal should be straightforward rules that set expectations up front: keep neighbourhoods attractive and livable, while still allowing practical, well-designed housing.  ",Yes,,,"If we say we value heritage homes, then the standards need to have teeth. Clear, enforceable rules protect what makes older neighbourhoods unique while still allowing sensible development.     As always, we must consult with the impacted communities, not operate in isolation within City Hall.",Yes,,,"100%. This is exactly the kind of approach I’ve been pushing for.    Blanket policies don’t work. Growth needs to be smart, targeted, and shaped by the people who live in each neighbourhood. That means putting new housing near transit and jobs, making sure the infrastructure can handle it, and bringing residents along in the process.    That’s how you build strong communities instead of conflict.  ",Yes,,,"If residents feel shut out, then yes, we should take another look.    I actually like the idea of Local Area Plans. Done right, they help shape growth in a way that fits a community’s character. But I’ve heard from many Calgarians who felt the recent plans were rushed and their feedback ignored. That undermines trust and makes it harder to implement.    There’s no harm in slowing down to get it right. A plan with real community buy-in will save issues later.  ",Yes,,,"Restrictive covenants are a valid part of the suite of planning instruments. They set expectations for neighbourhoods. Ignoring them feels like ignoring the residents who live there.    At the very least, Calgarians deserve an open, transparent conversation about how these covenants fit into planning decisions. People need to know their concerns aren’t being brushed aside.  ",Yes,,,"If communities feel City Hall is using special zoning as a loophole, that erodes trust in the whole system.    As a City Councillor, I would support reviewing this practice. Planning only works when people believe the rules are being applied fairly and openly, and not bent to get around long-standing community expectations.

0,,No,,"No. As the current sitting Ward 1 Councillor, I voted against blanket rezoning. ",Yes,,,"My message has been clear. Repeal, re-instate, reform. Along with my other Communities First candidates, if elected, we will repeal blanket rezoning. This isn't about opposing new development — it’s about supporting smart development. One-size-fits-all zoning doesn’t work for every community. Most importantly, Calgarians lost a vital opportunity to speak directly to their elected officials about developments in their own neighborhoods, neighborhoods they know best.  ",Yes,,,"If elected, one of my top priorities is to restore the public hearing process and cut the cost of land use applications to the City (currently $13,000), so Calgarians can speak directly to their elected officials when applications for rowhouses and townhouses are applied for in established communities. I would also like to see contextual rules reintroduced. Some examples where this could be applied include contextual building heights, building front setbacks and obscure second storey windows.     As the current Ward 1 Councillor, I successfully brought forward an amendment during the blanket rezoning hearing to address privacy concerns raised by Calgarians who will be living next to new infill developments.  ",Yes,,,Yes. As the current Ward 1 Councillor I sponsored a Notice of Motion which would have directed Administration to hold a plebiscite on blanket rezoning as part of the 2025 General Election. It was unfortunately defeated by the Council majority. ,I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,,,No,,"No. I do not support changing the Land Use Bylaw “use” definition of an “addiction treatment centre” from a permitted to a discretionary use. I am aware that this is being proposed in the new Zoning Bylaw currently under development by the City’s Planning Department and will need approval by the next Mayor and Council. Discretionary uses are categorized as such so the community has the opportunity to have a voice before decisions are made.     I am supportive of halfway houses and addiction treatment centres. There are many important considerations to be taken in their planning, development and locations. Building an effective working relationship with the Province will be one of my top priorities as Mayor so we can work together on this complex issue.    Regarding rowhouses, prior to blanket rezoning they were listed as permitted in areas of the City where they made sense, such as  main streets and near transit. I am supportive of maintaining permitted rowhouses in these types of areas, and permitted use still provides the option to appeal at SDAB.  ",,No,,"I don’t believe blanket rezoning is the answer to improving Calgary’s housing supply and improving affordability. We need a balanced solution that will streamline The City’s planning process, keep taxes and fees affordable through transparent budgeting, all while protecting the voice of the community.     In July, CREB shared their housing priorities. I’m proud to say they align with the work I’ve been doing as a Councillor, and my beliefs around blanket rezoning  ",Yes,,,"Yes. I spoke up about this at the Public Hearing Meeting of Council in 2024 with the example of a single family home in an established community, approximate value at $700k, being rented to one family for $2000 per month. If that home was demolished and a six-plex was proposed, the value of one unit in that six-plex, would cost more money than the original home so the developer and builder would make a profit.",Yes,,,"Yes. I am concerned that long-standing residents and Calgarians will not be able to age in their neighbourhoods, especially if more affordable seniors housing is not provided.",,No,,"No. I voted against every budget in my four years as Ward 1 Councillor. The budget approval brought with it a 3.6% increase to the property taxes collected by the City, with an average 5.5% increase for homeowners across Calgary. The budget reporting was not detailed enough to ensure infrastructure projects and front line services were prioritized.    Throughout the budget process, I proposed or seconded several amendments aimed at reducing this pressure. These included:    - Reducing Executive Leadership spending and budgets: Proposals to cut discretionary travel and entertainment budgets and reduce the Executive Leadership office budget were rejected by Council. These measures would have asked leadership to operate more efficiently, as Calgarians do every day.  - Reestablishing the Finance & Budget Committee: I advocated for the reintroduction of a dedicated committee to bring clarity to the budget process and ensure greater transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent.  - Reducing the impact of tax shifts: Amendments were proposed to alleviate the tax burden on homeowners by addressing the tax shift from businesses to residents.    Despite my efforts, all of these amendments were defeated by the current Council.   ",Yes,,,"I am not confident our established neighbourhoods have the right infrastructure in place to support increased density. I experienced this first-hand as Ward 1 Councillor when density strained the water infrastructure and led to several water main breaks and disruptions for Bowness and Montgomery.     I proposed a Notice of Motion alongside Communities First candidate and Ward 7 Councillor Terry Wong, titled “ ""Infrastructure Health, Safety, and Reliability - Bowness & Montgomery"" to pause development in Bowness and Montgomery in order to review the infrastructure. This failed with this current City Council. If it was approved, the following actions would have been taken:  - Comprehensive infrastructure assessment: Administration would have conducted a detailed report on critical infrastructure within Bowness and Montgomery, examining roads, water and wastewater systems, storm sewers, parks, and green spaces.  - Evaluating density impact: The report would have assessed the effects of increased density on aging infrastructure, identifying social, economic, and budgetary impacts.  - Regular updates & reporting: Administration would have provided updates to the Infrastructure and Planning Committee, with a full report expected by June 2025.  - Temporary pause on new high-density development permits: Residential development applications submitted after August 26, 2024, that exceeded four units and four secondary suites would have been temporarily paused.  These actions would have been critical in understanding the impacts of densification in our older neighbourhoods, but this current Council simply did not want to know the answer to that.   ",Yes,,,Yes. I believe a comprehensive infrastructure assessment would be a huge asset to ensuring our City infrastructure can keep up with the demand of new development. This is especially important in established communities.  ,,No,,"No. It should be 1 stall per unit. Reductions could be considered through the development permit review if applications are near existing transit, LRT’s, BRT’s and frequent bus routes.   ",,No,,"No. As the current Ward 1 Councillor, I proposed an amendment during the public hearing on rezoning, requiring a minimum of 1 parking stall for each primary and secondary suite across all rezoned areas. This was unfortunately defeated. This is also being proposed in the upcoming Calgary Plan zoning bylaw update that the next Mayor and Council will be voting on.  ",,No,,"No. Established trees have root systems that in most cases require tree removal regardless of parcel coverage. They could also be cut down by the next owner and the City does not get involved in private landscaping. I would support retaining trees where possible and stronger enforcement of protection of trees on public property. Through the new Zoning Bylaw, tree planting requirements currently in the Land Use Bylaw 1p2007 for infill development should be maintained or increased.  ",,No,"No. If developments are zoned as a park space, they must remain a park space. Park spaces are essential for communities. The City should invest more into existing park space and adding park space where possible. I have been, and will continue to be, an advocate for the protection and maintenance of our park space for Calgarians physical and mental well-being, as well as making our communities more desirable and livable.   ",Yes,,,"Yes. In 2024, Communities First candidates and Councillors Andre Chabot and Terry Wong brought forward a Notice of Motion to direct City Administration to report back on implementing measures, including a potential Bylaw, that would help preserve and grow trees on private land. In 2025, City Administration came back with a recommendation to incentivise the retention of trees. This work is still underway and I will be supporting it while keeping in mind that over-regulation of private landscaping could impact some homeowners negatively.  For example: large trees that could fall and cause damage or injury to people, or roots that impact infrastructure. Setbacks could be implemented for new trees to help with these situations and ensure healthy trees going forward.  ",Yes,,,"Yes. I have always, and will continue to, support preserving and expanding parks, school playing fields and community playgrounds.   ",Yes,,,"Yes. Development should be contextual with adjacent homes in terms of building heights and setbacks. Regarding architectural elements, if there are historic buildings on the same street or area, developers should consider incorporating that into the design. I will encourage and champion creative designs that are not “cookie cutter”.  ",Yes,,,,Yes,,,,Yes,,,"When done correctly, LAP's provide certainty for residents on upcoming developments that could impact them in their neighbourhoods. As such, I don't believe all LAP’s should have a pause and review as that would stall development and smart planning in the City.     That being said, there have been Local Area Plans I have voted against in my tenure as a Councillor and Infrastructure and Planning Committee Chair. These were either not ready for primetime, or great opposition from the community.     A major concern coming from community members is that not all of the feedback is captured by Administration during the LAP engagement process. To mitigate this, Councillor Wong and I,  brought forward a notice of motion called “Strengthening Transparency: Improving Engagement with Calgarians” that was approved by Council so this work is underway. The current public engagement framework lacks consistency, particularly in how resident feedback is integrated into Council and City decisions. The motion proposes adopting best practices to create a more reliable process where resident input is transparently woven into the City’s work.   ",Yes,,,"The current process in place is that the City Planning Department follows the legislative requirements of Part 17 of the Municipal Government Act. This is not a municipal requirement, therefore the next Mayor and Council would need to work with the Government of Alberta to update this section and ultimately the development and land use application process. This would need further review and consideration.  ",,No,,"If a Direct Control District is approved through the public hearing process, a restrictive covenant remains on the land title. Currently, the Land Use Bylaw (section 20) that sets out the rules for direct controls does not include restrictive covenants as part of the approval process. Direct Controls must only be used for the purpose of providing developments “that, due to their unique characteristics, innovative ideas or unusual site constraints, require specific regulation unavailable in other land use districts.” Direct Controls are needed in some cases to enable development. Direct Control applications come to Public Hearing Meetings of Council and Council decisions should be made on a site by site basis.  ",Mayor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sonya,Sharp,,,hello@sharpformayor.ca,Thank you so much for the great work that you all do to make Calgary a better place to live!

0,,No,,"This was a massive case of A didn't equal Z for me. The action wasn't going to produce the result that they all felt this would achieve. It was so clear, only if you were willing to open your eyes and look. ",Yes,,,"Repealing the bylaw is the easiest, especially now that the six-month window has passed all that is required is a majority vote. Prior to, a reconsideration of the bylaw would have been required, and this would have required 10 votes to overturn. There was nothing wrong with the RC-1 single family designation so no need to reinvent the wheel here. I will either bring for the Notice of Motion myself or sign on with the others that I know want to do the same. ",Yes,,,"See here is the kicker. The previous process of going before council to change your land use to multi was working just fine. The approval rate was 96.5%, with over 3% of those not approved coming back and getting approved with amended plans. If the past process only approved 50-60% then yes three was a problem with the process but there clearly wasn't. Sure it cost applicants money to do this but the amount of money that this is costing landowners in loss of property value impacted by applications, far surpasses that.   ",Yes,,,"But here would be my concerns with Plebiscites 1. Defining what is considered major could be a challenge, we can't afford to hold one every year. 2. Costs associated with plebiscites especially if they are done outside of a general election. The Olympic bid plebiscite back November of 2018 was held after the 2017 municipal election, this cost us 7 million to do, however it was estimated that adding it to the municipal election would have cost around $500 thousand. 3. I know in Ward 14, there was no reason to hold a plebiscite because it was crystal clear. 4. Then there is the validly of the results, non-binding so is a plebiscite no better than this type of survey if the Councilors don't plan to honor it. 5. As a councillor you are elected by the people to represent the people, some do and some don't. Perhaps there needs to be an amendment to the MGA that has a section that holds a councillor accountable for blatantly ignoring their constituents. ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Look, plain and simple here. Anything that will have a direct effect on the very fabric of a community needs to be done with a healthy collaboration of all impacted, be that directly or indirectly. This is what the Local Area Plan was designed to accomplish. Was it perfect no but it wasn't even given a chance. Take a few communities and have a health conversation over is re-identification and together come up with a vision. ",,No,,"Again, until council realizes that we are not the experts just the vessel for our citizens and that without engagement and collaboration then we are no better than a government dictatorship. Don't get me wrong uses like the ones you listed above are very important and need to be a focus on creating a healthy city, but you can't prioritize this by removing people right to express their opinions, be it for or against. ",Yes,,,"Prior to my 10 years serving ward 14 as community assistant, I spent a decade selling residential real estate, so I have knowledge in the housing market. The debate I had with the 9 councillors that pushed this was, ok if we are doing this to increase housing starts by removing perceived barriers and oversaturate the market so that pricing comes down, then what is the targeted price range or housing void? Is it 200 - 350, is it 400 - 550, is it 600 - 750 or what? See until we identify that targeted void and place parameters around filling that void then ANY new development will be done to best serve market demand. No small or large market developer is going to create product that cuts into their profit and frankly expecting them to do so is crazy. The only fundamental way to address affordable housing is by all three levels of government participating in some type of subsidy. Say for example we ask builder X who is building a 600 unit condo to make sure 10% is allocated for low-income housing, they simply will say no or find a way around it. Now if there was a subsidy or some type of financial adjustment offered for offering a $300,000 condo at let's say half for qualified low income buyers, then you would see way more of an uptick on getting positive steps forward in address this issue. To even imply that the rezoning was going to address or have any impact whatsoever on the housing market in Calgary was plain and simple magic bean nonsense. ",Yes,,,"100%, look Calgary is the third most investable city in Canada after Toronto and Vancouver. There are situations in Toronto where it's cheaper to leave the residential lot vacant, let the land value increase and simply pay the annual property tax than it is to do any type of community benefiting development. I heard a story of an investor selling one condo in Toronto then coming to Calgary and buying three and renting them all out at the same rental rates as down east. With out a proper foreign investment policy any stock, be it land only or new builds, these will never hit the intended market.  ",Yes,,,"Back to my previous comment, third most investable city in Canada. Without a policy around foreign investors why wouldn't they invest in Calgary, and to expect that this wouldn't have a direct impact on affordable rental opportunities in Calgary is simply not wanting to care. We will tell residents, hey your grass needs to be cut, hey you can't be pilling up landscaping bricks along the back of your house, but we don't even want to look at establishing parameters around rental rates? Just saying.",,No,,"So, I understand the question as it relates to the objective but here is what I will qualify. The very objective of the blanket rezoning was to allow for RCG style development in well-established single-family communities, so older communities. Older communities have seen population declines over the years but now are getting back to previous numbers. Now all new development already allows for this densification and infrastructure is required to supposedly accommodate this but that's a debate for another day. What I am getting at is older communities like the one I live in, Midnapore, were built with much larger infrastructure requirements, roadways, sidewalks, sanitation lines, etc. Fish Creek water treatment plant for example is running at 35% capacity, now that's by design because of its pending renovations but after that won't be any close to maximum capacity. The older infrastructure was built bigger and better so the question should be more is the city adequately budgeting or preparing for the replacement of this older infrastructure period. ",Yes,,,"but I will say that in my experience, especially in Ward 14 where we have a balance of older established communities and new ones. It's the new ones that lack everything highlighted in the background comment. Our new communities had limited transit because of the poor ridership model transit uses, they lack schools, lack emergency services and greenspaces that actually cater to mixed use. Our older communities have all of this, but I understand the context of this more pertaning to inner city older communities experiencing forced growth and densification. ",Yes,,,"As far as I know, there has never been a case where someone said, ""this is too much information"" so yes. ",,No,,"Ridiculous, this is the only comment I have for this. ",,No,,"The sooner we wrap our heads around the lack of efficient transit services and the fact that we are a winter city, the sooner we can pull our heads out of this ideology of no one uses cars anymore. ",,No,,"Here's why I said no. Currently Urban Forestry is underfunded and under managed. This is a work in progress but under the current popular replacement program for every popular tree removed they plan 5 more trees in the same community. This programs funding only allows for a limited amount of again popular to be removed. A notice of motion we supported by Andre will aim to increase the funding and focus on improving this. So, I guess what I am saying is, the urban forestry program has lots of room for improvement and more planting and with collaborations with our office we have identified several locations that can use more trees. Again, it comes down to funding, but we are headed in the right direction. ",,No,"Don't even try it. This city has plenty of underutilized real estate that is prime for densification, Anderson TOD as one example. ",Yes,,,,Yes,,,"but i think first of all we need to assess if we are properly using the green spaces we have now. For example, please stop making green spaces and just putting in one ball diamond and four soccer fields that never get used. Let make this space exciting, inviting and something that reflects how people interact with green space. Oh, while we are at it, we need to look at changing standards where we allow for crap dirt and grass seeding to be used, these only turn into acres of dandelions that multiply over and over, rendering the fields useless.  ",Yes,,,"but only if everyone is involved in creating these design standards. A robust conversation on what's durable for the Calgary climate, also each neighbourhood has its own characteristics. So, it's almost like if we have a Local Area Pland that took all these things into consideration, oh wait, we had one. ",Yes,,,"100% We do such a crap job of retaining our heritage and history, unless it's in areas that are headline worthy, but we cannot forget that the rest of the city also has history and heritage benefits. ",Yes,,,"Can never have enough conversations. Oh, and perhaps next time we can engage the Calgary Real Estate Board as last time I checked they have a good understanding and perhaps some valuable insight into the Calgary market. ",Yes,,,"Administration didn't even give it a chance. Was it perfect, no, but the last few questions on this survey could all form pillars on the LAP process. ",,,,"I am not answering this for no other reason than, city administration and 9 councillors forced the public to grasp at whatever so they could to save the character of their communities. Do restricted covenants accomplish this, I don't fully understand the legal parameters around these, but my understanding is that it will pit neighbours against neighbours and that's unfortunate. There was a process that was working and allowed for someone to apply for a change of use, and then the public had a chance to have their say. Allowing applicants to skirt around this through the direct control process is so shady. ",Yes,,,"Don't be sketchy, that being said, if there is a loophole, it needs to be closed. Plain and simple but that depends on who get voted in. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ward 14,Devin,Elkin,,,delkin@telus.net,"If elected as councillor for Ward 14 I will be bring forward a notice of motion that will prevent a repeat of the 7 day public hearing embarrassment that many of us witnessed and ensure that people feel heard. It reads as follows, ""There for be it resolved; in the event that a public hearing item garners more than two consecutive days of public hearing submissions, this will automatically trigger a pause in the file and a reengagement of those impacted, be it direct or indirect"". In the 10 years serving I can only recall a few, Rezoning, Floride, Olympic bid, currie barracks redevelopment but this will prevent the complete disregard we witnessed with the zoning public hearing. Thank you for putting this together. It was well done."

0,,No,,City Council did not listen to Calgarians and should have sought more collaborative and tailored solutions to the housing issue. ,Yes,,,,Yes,,,"Repealing this policy would open the door for land-use designations and Local Area Plans (LAPs) to be properly re-evaluated, including the option of returning to the previous zoning framework. This is a crucial step to ensure that future planning decisions reflect the real priorities of our communities, encourage responsible and balanced growth, and account for both infrastructure capacity and neighbourhood character. As a long-time community association board director, I witnessed first-hand how land-use redesignation applications and public hearings provided a necessary and valuable process for residents to have their voices heard.",,No,,Voters want plebiscites only when they think Council is ignoring their wishes.  It is far too late to hold a plebiscite on blanket rezoning in the upcoming election and the majority of the Calgarians do not want to live with this policy for another four years. We have heard residents loud and clear. I believe the new Council knows what Calgarians want.,I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,,,No,,,,No,,"Blanket rezoning in Calgary has not yet clearly resulted in reduced housing costs. While it has undeniably spurred more housing supply and eased development hurdles, the affordability benefits—both for buying and renting—remain unproven.    A targeted strategy will be more effective in creating affordable homes. By working with trusted non-profit housing providers, we can create homes that are truly within reach for those who need them most: young people, newcomers, single parents, the working poor, and seniors. These are the Calgarians being left behind by rising costs. Targeted investment in affordable housing will be more effective in helping ensure they have safe, stable places to live than with the current unfocused approach.",Yes,,,"Yes. I believe we need a certain level of mandatory inclusionary policy, particularly in areas where affordable housing makes the most sense—such as along transit corridors and near commercial areas. While I generally believe in letting the market dictate development, this is a case where we must ensure affordable mixed-income housing options are available.",Yes,,,"For those living near new multiplex builds, we’re already seeing issues like increased noise, excessive street parking, and a decline in neighbourhood quality of life. At the same time, people in existing affordable rentals are being pushed out because homeowners are being offered massive sums of money to sell, creating strong incentives for redevelopment. The result is that lower-income and long-standing residents are being squeezed out rather than supported, which is the opposite of what equitable development should look like.",,No,,"We see this first-hand in Ward 6. To ensure that growth is sustainable and does not outpace community needs, we must take a measured approach:    1) Develop where infrastructure already exists rather than forcing density into areas that cannot support it.    2) If densification is proposed, ensure proper infrastructure is in place first—including roads, transit, water, sewer, and emergency services.    3) Work with the Province to guarantee schools can accommodate increased enrollment, so children aren’t left in overcrowded classrooms or bused far outside their communities.    4) Ensure parks, recreation facilities, and green spaces are protected and expanded to maintain livability.    5) Prioritize funding for essential services like police, fire, and EMS so that response times and safety are not compromised.    Blanket upzoning ignored these critical considerations, and without proper planning, it risks putting additional strain on already stretched infrastructure and public services.",Yes,,,"Absolutely. In Ward 6, I am already seeing communities being heavily impacted by the blanket rezoning policy—inadequate road capacity, too few school spaces, loss of greenspace, or safety concerns in neighbourhoods where traffic has increased and exit points are limited. In my opinion, infrastructure should always match or exceed the planned development before moving ahead with any project. ",Yes,,,"This is smart, common-sense planning. Every proposed upzoning or major intensification project should be assessed to ensure that sewer, water, electrical systems, transit, roads, greenspace, and schools can handle the additional demand before moving forward.    Other cities already recognize the value of this approach such as Toronto, Vancouver and Portland.     Calgary should build on their experience. By requiring Infrastructure Capacity Reviews, we can prevent overloading existing systems, protect quality of life in our communities, and ensure development happens responsibly and sustainably.",,No,,"It is unrealistic to expect residents of any development, regardless of size, to make do with only 0.5 parking stalls per unit. This is bad policy that is already creating excessive numbers of cars parked on residential streets, and frustrating both new and long-standing residents. Calgary is a large, spread-out city where the majority of people rely on their vehicles to get to work, school, and everyday activities. In our cold climate, walking or cycling isn’t always practical or safe. Policies must reflect the reality of how Calgarians live, not force them into an unworkable standard.",,No,,"If given the choice developers may be tempted to eliminate on-site parking to lowers construction costs, but most Calgarians own a vehicle. Street parking should not be their only option.",Yes,,,"I believe protecting Calgary’s tree canopy must be a priority. Removing too many trees has serious ill-effects on our communities. It reduces natural shade and cooling, which worsens urban heat in the summer and increases energy use. It contributes to poorer air quality, since trees act as natural filters. It can also worsen drainage and flooding issues, as tree roots absorb large amounts of stormwater. Beyond environmental impacts, losing trees diminishes neighbourhood character, reduces property values, and harms overall livability. A healthy, well-maintained tree canopy is essential for both environmental resilience and quality of life in our city.",,No,"Greenspaces are vital to the physical health and wellness of our communities. Once lost, they are not easily replaced. They must be protected for now.",Yes,,,"In Ward 6, I’ve already seen several high-density developments remove beautiful Aspen areas and once these natural assets are gone, they are nearly impossible to replace. Vancouver has bylaws that mandate tree replacement when removals occur. Calgary should follow suit with balanced policies that respect property rights while ensuring long-term protection of our urban forest.",Yes,,,"These spaces are essential for kids to stay busy, active, and healthy, while giving them the opportunity to get outside for fresh air and unstructured play. Parks and recreation areas also strengthen community bonds, promote physical and mental well-being for all ages, and enhance the overall livability of our neighbourhoods. Protecting and expanding greenspaces is an investment.",Yes,,,"Infill developments should absolutely be subject to mandatory and enforceable design standards that respect the context and character of neighbouring homes and streets. Proper enforcement helps maintain the unique identity of each community — something we are already seeing tarnished under the current blanket rezoning policy. Without clear design standards, neighbourhood character is eroded and the sense of place that residents value is diminished. Thoughtful, well-regulated infills can add housing while still protecting the look, feel, and livability of our communities.",Yes,,,"As noted earlier, I support design standards that respect the character of neighbourhoods, which could include respect for heritage. Once a heritage building is gone, it cannot be replaced, so care must be taken in developing these areas.",Yes,,,"I support a planning approach that always includes the voices and input of the largest stakeholders in our communities — our community associations and residents. These are the people most directly impacted by growth, and their knowledge and perspectives are invaluable. Planning must also carefully consider infrastructure capacity and services, sustainability, and the local context to ensure that new housing is added in a way that strengthens neighbourhoods rather than overwhelms them. Meaningful community input leads to better decisions, greater trust, and development that truly reflects the needs and priorities of Calgarians.",Yes,,,"If the blanket rezoning policy is successfully repealed with a new City Council, then LAPs will also need to be paused and reviewed. I am in full support of this! Communities deserve a real voice in shaping their future, and it is only fair that planning documents reflect genuine consultation with community associations and residents.",Yes,,,"These covenants are legal agreements that residents and communities entered into with the expectation that they would help protect neighbourhood character, stability, and quality of life. Disregarding them undermines trust and creates uncertainty for homeowners.",Yes,,,"Special zoning, such as Direct Control districts, that circumvent restrictive covenants erodes respect and trust in City officials. Homeowners and communities rely on these covenants in good faith. Ignoring them undermines the integrity of the planning process.

0,,No,,"After 9 months of campaigning, and meeting with residents across Ward 9, including developers, I can say that the general feeling is that this has had a negative impact on these communities. This is partly because genuine concerns from existing residents in these neighbourhoods have been ignored.    Cutting red tape, and bringing more housing online across the city is an appropriate thing to pursue. As it relates to Ward 9 and the historic neighbourhoods here - a blanket approach poses real and serious risk to the qualities we love about these places. It has taken generations of Calgarians to define these neighbourhoods and that cannot be erased in our pursuit of growth.     ",,,Undecided,"I would like to see this policy amended to better reflect the diversity of needs/wants of these neighbourhoods. After all, this policy has come to pass under this current council, at great expense to the tax payers of Calgary.     Can we find ways to cut the red tape while setting parameters that better reflect the look and feel of these communities? After all, in Ward 9, we are talking about the RE-development of these neighbourhoods. If not, and with disappointment, I would vote to start over. ",,No,,"I think that if we are to remove this policy entirely, we should look at how to improve these processes as a whole, moving forward. I've heard many complaints on the doors about the application and public hearing processes. Let's not lose sight of the intended goal of this policy, which was to streamline the process and cut red tape. If we are to start again, we should do so with that same intention and improve this process - not just return to the way it was. ",Yes,,,"If the ""engagement"" process proves to be ineffective (which I hear regularly that it is) then the citizens of Calgary should have the right to set a plebiscite in motion. ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Community character is an important part of city growth. Each neighbouhood in Ward 9 is a reflection of generations of people investing their lives in these neighbourhoods. In some cases multiple generations. We should be proactive in making sure that unique community character is reflecting in the planning and investments made in these neighbourhoods. With that said, Calgary is a growing urban centre, and we cannot ignore or avoid the obligation to meet that growth. ",,No,,I take issue with classifying rowhousing and addiction treatment centres as the same type of change in a neighbourhood. The introduction of social programming in a community is an important change that must be discussed and designed with community input.,,No,,"Across Ward 9 I've met with many folks struggling with housing affordability. We often think of it as young people not being able to find a place in these neighbourhoods - but it is also older people not being able to stay in their communities. I believe in a complete community concept, where the people who work at our favourite neighbourhood coffee shops and restaurants can also live in the neighbourhoods they serve. I believe in promoting ""gentle density"" measures that allow for laneway, carriage and secondary home suits to come online with priority so older folks are better positioned to age in place securely.     We see a number of successful cooperative housing projects built in the 1970s peppered across the city of Calgary in neighbourhoods like Sunnyside, Ramsay, Winston Heights. I would like to explore the application of this model today.     Finally, I believe we need to review the inventory of city owned lands across the Ward, and work with community partners who specialize in mixed-income and affordable housing to bring these projects online with efficiency. Uniquely in Ward 9, we see an integration of I-G legacy industrial lands that closely border historic neighbourhoods like Inglewood, Ramsay, Ogden and Dover. With the appropriate reclamation strategy, we may be able to increase the residential footprint of these existing, historic neighbourhoods.       ",Yes,,,"Doorknocking in the neighbourhoods of Ward 9, I have come across a number of empty, beautiful homes - some times multiple on a single block. These homes have gardens and streetscapes that look like they had been maintained up until last year. I was shocked at the number of empty houses I've come across. And I've talked with long term renters who are being evicted. I've also heard residents describe being ""harassed"" to sell their homes on multiple occasions.     Some of this is inherent to the process of re-development and growth. But it does feel like a very unbalanced relationship between development and the neighbourhoods being ""developed"".",,,,"Let's be fair - growth, density, and redevelopment all risk creating scenarios of pressure on existing residents in these neighbourhoods with or without this zoning policy.     We must actively participate in making sure that seniors, renters and low-income citizens have space in our communities.

I am advocating for a fair share of investment in Ward 9. These old communities represent the oldest tax base in the city. It's time for those dollars to come home and be invested here so we are properly prepared to meet our growing population and demand. ,Yes,,,"Revising and/or phasing densification in these areas makes good sense to me. We have now all experienced what happens when catastrophic failure of a system like water occurs.     I would be particularly interested in seeing these assessments in Ward 9, where we have 100+ year old neighbourhoods. ",Yes,,,Where it is determined to be of great value to the decision process. I would hate to burden the calgary tax payer with another expense! ,,No,,"Many of the neighbourhoods in Ward 9 are desirable because of their proximity to civic amenities and downtown. If we are to invite more people into these communities, we must simultaneously invest in safe, alternative modes of transportation like public transit, cycling, walking and scooters.     I am well aware that Calgary is a driving city and that most people would agree that you *need* a car to live here. It is safe to say that we will never fully solve the parking problem in Calgary while simultaneously gaining in population and density without supporting alternative modes of transportation. At this rate, we may end up having to simply pave over a residential lot on each block, and designate it a parking lot.     Dark humour aside, each party must take its share of responsibility here. If you are introducing 4 or 8 new dwellings on a street, you must take responsibility for how those homes will engage with the block, including where they will park their vehicles. The City of Calgary, and council must take the responsibility of transportation and community connectivity seriously, planning and investing in it accordingly. ",,No,,"If you are building new dwellings on an existing street, you must take some responsibility for how it integrates into that community. This includes parking concerns. ",Yes,,,"Research and observation has already confirmed that this is the case. I have spoken with advocates in Renfrew and Bridgeland, which are two neighbourhoods that have been hit hard by an aging tree canopy and redevelopment. Bridgeland has been described as a ""hot zone"" meaning that it is hotter there than the surrounding areas because of loss of shading.    We must work to renew our canopy and to grow it. I have committed to doubling Ward 9's contribution to the city's existing strategy to growing our urban canopy. This means planting approximately 1000 trees across the Ward. A very feasible commitment. ",Yes,,Not all green spaces and parks of course. But in appropriate scenarios I don't think we should avoid exploring the idea. ,Yes,,,,Yes,,,"As our neighbourhoods grow and renew, we should take great care in providing space for residents to connect and build community. Parks, recreation and community centres are great places to build and strengthen those connections. ",Yes,,,"If you are walking into Ogden, Ramsay, Southview, Bridgeland, Inglewood or any of the neighbourhoods in Ward 9 you have to understand that you are stepping into an existing context. A context that is decades in the making. I think it is perfectly reasonable to say that if you are going to redevelop in these neighbourhoods, you need to work within that existing context.",Yes,,,"As it stands, Calgary does not have an effective or apropriate set of heritage policies that supports the maintenance or protection of our historic residential and commercial inventory. We must work to expand the city's heritage grants, support easy and efficient access to these funds for both commercial and residential applications. ",Yes,,,It's fair to say that the upcoming policy we have discussed today has not been as effective as perhaps originally intended. We should learn from these shortfalls and meet the challenges of our growing city collaboratively. ,,,Undecided,"As councillor for Ward 9, I would be happy to commit to reviewing the existing LAPs with those community parties who were involved in producing them - to review how these may need to be updated, or re-worked. ",,,Undecided,"In some cases yes, but let's make sure that these covenants hold the same meaning in the current version of this neighbourhood, as they did when they were put in place. Reviewing the relevance of these covenants in the present context of these communities is as important in this hypothetical scenario.

0,,No,,"I do not support the blanket upzoning bylaw. Planning decisions that reshape our neighbourhoods should involve real consultation with residents, not a one-size-fits-all approach from City Hall. Communities like those in Ward 14 were built on the principle of stability and homeowner input, and residents deserve a voice in decisions that affect their streets, parking, traffic flow, and quality of life.    Upzoning may make sense in targeted areas where infrastructure, schools, and services can handle the growth, but forcing it across the entire city creates more problems than solutions.",Yes,,,"From the first day I have stated that I will advocate and vote for a full repeal of the blanket upzoning bylaw. My position is that communities should have a voice in shaping the character of their neighborhoods, and decisions on density and zoning should not be imposed city-wide without proper consultation. A repeal should restore the prior zoning framework (e.g., R-C1, R-C2) so that residents and community associations regain the ability to participate meaningfully in planning and land-use decisions. I believe in thoughtful, community-driven development that balances growth with respect for existing neighborhoods.",Yes,,,"I support repealing the blanket upzoning bylaw because it stripped residents of their right to have a say in what gets built in their neighborhoods. Restoring the previous land use districts, contextual rules, and the requirement for public hearings ensures that development respects community character, infrastructure capacity, and taxpayer priorities. Growth must happen, but it should be balanced, transparent, and accountable to residents not pushed through by City Hall without proper consultation",,,Undecided,"While Calgary’s Municipal Government Act does empower City Council to hold plebiscites non‑binding, community votes on significant policy shifts. I believe residents should have a stronger voice in planning decisions, but I am open to different tools, such as plebiscites, binding consultations, or stronger local engagement depending on the scale of the issue. Blanket rezoning, for example, was approved after weeks of the most substantial hearing in Calgary’s history, with nearly a thousand Calgarians participating. ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Prior to the blanket upzoning, residents had the opportunity to raise concerns and influence the shape of their communities through hearings and public input. Removing this process silences local voices and creates a one-size-fits-all approach that may not respect the uniqueness of each neighbourhood. I believe densification must be balanced with genuine consultation to protect community character, ensure infrastructure keeps pace, and build trust between City Hall and residents.",,No,,"While we must find balanced solutions to issues like addiction recovery, transitional housing, and housing diversity, residents deserve transparency and a say in how these facilities are placed in their communities. I support responsible development but with proper consultation, accountability, and safeguards for both community members and vulnerable populations.",,No,,"While the City of Calgary reports that since rezoning began in August 2024, development applications have surged with a 59% increase in applications for new housing in established areas in early 2025, this has not translated into lower housing costs.    I will prioritize infill only where it fits, focusing on neighbourhoods near transit corridors or areas already slated for redevelopment, rather than broad-brush giving every single-family zone blanket rezoning. ",Yes,,,"I agree that blanket upzoning can fuel speculation and drive up land values without addressing affordability. To prevent this, I would support:    Targeted zoning changes tied to actual community needs rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.    Affordability requirements such as inclusionary housing or mixed-income development that ensure new projects deliver real benefits for families, seniors, and first-time buyers.    Stronger community input before redevelopment approvals, so residents have a voice in shaping growth.",Yes,,,"While I support responsible growth and the need for more housing, I believe blanket upzoning, without careful planning can put pressure on long-standing families and lower-income residents. Rising land values and redevelopment can unintentionally drive people out of their own communities, and I think the City needs safeguards to protect affordability and stability while we plan for growth.",,No,,"I do not believe the City has adequately planned and budgeted for the infrastructure and public service demands that blanket upzoning would create. While the idea of increased density may have merits, growth without matching investments in roads, water and sewer systems, schools, emergency services, and transit will strain communities and reduce quality of life.    To ensure infrastructure and public services are aligned with future growth, I would support:    Phased growth planning tying density approvals to actual infrastructure upgrades, not promises.    Dedicated funding ensuring revenue from growth is reinvested back into the affected communities rather than spread too thin citywide.    Impact assessments requiring detailed studies on traffic, schools, utilities, and emergency services before major rezoning approvals.",Yes,,,"Growth must be responsible and not come at the expense of existing residents. If infrastructure and services are already strained, it makes sense to pause or phase in densification until those needs are addressed.",Yes,,,"Any decision on upzoning should be tied to clear data on whether local systems can handle the change. Infrastructure Capacity Reviews would ensure that we are not burdening communities with traffic gridlock, overloaded schools, or service disruptions.",,No,,Many families in Ward 14 and across Calgary rely on at least one vehicle per household often more. Cutting parking requirements too deeply creates spillover issues on neighborhood streets and frustrates residents. A balanced approach is needed that supports density near transit but still recognizes the real transportation needs of families.,,No,,"Eliminating on-site parking entirely shifts the burden onto existing communities and creates long-term problems with congestion, safety, and livability. Developers should not be given a free pass to ignore parking realities. Any changes must protect residents’ quality of life while promoting responsible development.",Yes,,,Growth in our city should not come at the expense of our trees and natural spaces. I believe we can expand housing in a balanced way while still protecting and planting more trees.,,No,"Parks and greenspaces are community assets. Redeveloping them into housing is short-sighted and undermines livability for families, seniors, and children.",Yes,,,I support incentives and practical policies that encourage tree planting and preservation. This can be done in a way that respects private property rights while strengthening our shared environment.,Yes,,,"Strong communities need safe and accessible greenspaces. I support working with developers, schools, and community associations to ensure that new communities have proper greenspace and that existing neighborhoods maintain theirs.",Yes,,,"Infill development is important for adding housing options, but it should not come at the expense of the character and integrity of established neighbourhoods. Enforceable standards would ensure that new builds respect setbacks, scale, and streetscapes, preserving the balance between growth and community identity.",Yes,,,"As councillor, I would work to ensure that development policies respect both community heritage and the pressing need for housing. Protecting our city’s history and character while supporting thoughtful growth is the best way to keep our neighbourhoods vibrant and livable for future generations.",Yes,,,"I believe growth in Calgary should be thoughtful, not one-size-fits-all. Blanket upzoning doesn’t always reflect the realities of infrastructure, schools, roads, and services in each community. I support a flexible planning approach that listens to residents, respects local context, and balances sustainability with livability so we can welcome growth while keeping communities strong.",Yes,,,"For me, planning must be community-driven, not imposed. Local voices matter, and I would work to restore a process that listens first, acts second, and delivers plans that reflect the needs and values of the people who live there.",Yes,,,Restrictive covenants should be respected when making planning decisions. They represent commitments made to homeowners and are part of what preserves the integrity and character of our established communities.,Yes,,,"As your councillor, I will advocate for responsible growth that balances new development with respect for the promises made to existing homeowners.

",,,Undecided,"We need to work in a plan that properly balance design, aesthetics, and services around including schools, recreation facilities, community cultural centres, and other amenities that can make each neighbourhood livable.

",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Community engagement is very important in the direction of our city.

On the contrary, prices are going up. Similar situation happened in Vancouver.   An alternative strategy is to evaluate the use of city land that is vacant to allocate to affordable housing developments.",Yes,,,Developers need to be engaged with the communities they are building to find ways to bring additional value to them. This can include a fund that can be allocated to the improvement of community centres for the delivery of better services and facilities to the community. ,Yes,,,"This is happening and is very concerning. I have talked to some neighbours that have not developed their houses, and that right now are surrounded by new developments. They are feeling the impact of significant increase in property taxes due to land value increases.

",,No,,One of our big challenges with the growth that we are experiencing is to modernize our infrastructure in different ways. The use of technology and modern systems will be critical to monitor our city systems. Some areas to allocate resources for improvement includes:  - Our transportation system. LRT and new routes.  - Roads Maintenance  - New technologies for traffic  - Replacement of aging water pipes  - More recreational facilities  - Support to essential services like fire halls infrastructure ,Yes,,,I have heard from citizens concerns about big new residential developments in our city that are happening without contemplating new schools or recreational facilities. ,Yes,,,"Any new development should be supported by the right city infrastructure and should consider the inclusion of schools, recreational space, and essential services that allow residents to maintain a greater style of life.

While I would prefer council to listen to that level of public input without requiring a plebiscite, I do believe Calgarians deserve the right to vote directly on significant city-wide planning changes if council continues to ignore the majority voice.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Growth must respect local character, infrastructure, and context, and that requires genuine consultation. Removing localized hearings through blanket upzoning was a mistake that undermined trust and silenced communities.",,No,,"Sensitive community uses and certain residential forms can have significant impacts on neighbourhoods, and residents deserve a meaningful voice in the process. Maintaining discretionary review ensures that developments are evaluated for context, design, and community impact before approval, balancing growth with livability and neighbourhood trust.",,No,,"I have been tracking sales in Ward 11, and so far, the price per housing unit has increased on every property that was rezoned to higher density. Blanket rezoning has primarily benefited developers and speculators, not residents looking for affordable housing. To truly improve affordability, we need targeted strategies: protect existing affordable homes, incentivize purpose-built affordable housing, focus growth along transit corridors and underused commercial areas with proper infrastructure, and ensure community input shapes where and how density is added.",Yes,,,"Yes, I agree that blanket upzoning risks fueling speculation and pushing out existing affordable housing. To ensure development actually benefits residents, I would support the following measures:    Targeted, infrastructure-ready growth – Focus density near transit corridors, along major roads, and in underused commercial/industrial areas where services, utilities, and amenities can support it.    Protect existing affordable housing – Strengthen policies that discourage demolitions of naturally affordable homes.    Responsible development incentives – Offer faster permitting and reduced red tape for projects that deliver real affordability, family-friendly housing, or seniors housing—not just luxury infills.    Transparency and accountability – Require clear affordability outcomes in city-supported developments and ensure community consultation is part of the process.    Blanket rezoning is too blunt a tool—it hands benefits to speculators without guaranteeing affordability. We need a more thoughtful, targeted approach that balances growth with affordability and community stability.",Yes,,,"I have already seen examples of this happening in rezoned lots, where older, affordable homes are being torn down to make way for higher-priced developments. Growth should be planned carefully to protect existing communities, preserve affordability, and ensure residents are not forced out of their neighbourhoods.",,No,,"Calgary still loses roughly 20% of its water supply due to leaks, and other core systems like roads, sewer, and transit are already under pressure. Increasing density without addressing these critical infrastructure needs only compounds the problem and risks reducing service reliability for existing and new residents alike.",Yes,,,"Growth should never outpace the capacity of water, sewer, transit, roads, schools, or emergency services. Phased or targeted development ensures that neighbourhoods can handle increased density without compromising service reliability or quality of life for existing residents. Responsible planning means matching density to infrastructure readiness, not imposing it uniformly across the city.",Yes,,,"Any proposed upzoning or major intensification should be evaluated to ensure that sewer, water, electrical, transit, roads, greenspace, and schools can handle the increased demand. This ensures growth is sustainable, protects service quality for existing residents, and prevents costly surprises from overburdened infrastructure.",,No,,"Most Calgarians still rely on vehicles for work, family responsibilities, and daily life. Cutting parking requirements this drastically would push cars onto streets, create congestion, and negatively impact neighbourhood livability. New developments need realistic parking solutions that reflect how residents actually live today, while still encouraging transit and active transportation where practical.",,No,,"No, I do not support eliminating on-site parking requirements. Calgary is still a city where most residents rely on their vehicles for work, family responsibilities, and daily life. Removing parking minimums without ensuring adequate alternatives only pushes cars onto already crowded streets, creating conflict and safety concerns in established communities. I believe new developments should include realistic parking solutions that reflect how Calgarians actually live today, while still encouraging transit use and active transportation where practical.",Yes,,,"Yes, I am very concerned. I have already seen firsthand on recently rezoned lots that mature, beautiful trees are being torn down to make way for redevelopment. Calgary’s urban tree canopy is not only important for neighbourhood character, but also for cooling, air quality, and stormwater management. Blanket upzoning accelerates this loss by prioritizing lot coverage over environmental and community value. We need stronger protections for existing trees and planning policies that balance development with preserving our natural assets.",,No,"When I ran in 2021, I ended our final debate by stating that I would never sell a greenspace in Ward 11 to a developer, and I stand by that today. Parks, playgrounds, and community greenspaces are essential for healthy, livable neighbourhoods, and should be preserved for residents rather than converted into housing.",Yes,,,"Mature trees are vital for neighbourhood character, air quality, cooling, stormwater management, and overall quality of life. Stronger protections, incentives to retain trees, and replacement requirements when removal is unavoidable should be part of any responsible development strategy.",Yes,,,"Yes, absolutely. Parks, playgrounds, and school fields are essential for healthy, livable communities. As Calgary grows, we need to protect existing greenspaces from being lost to overdevelopment while also ensuring that new communities are built with adequate parks and recreation areas. These spaces support families, active living, mental health, and community connection — they are not optional, they are core infrastructure.",Yes,,,"Yes, I believe infill developments should be subject to mandatory and enforceable design standards. Growth in established communities needs to be balanced with respect for neighbourhood character, privacy, and streetscapes. Right now, the non-binding guidelines are too easy to ignore, and we see new builds that overshadow existing homes or disrupt the feel of a street.",Yes,,,"Yes, I support requiring clear and enforceable heritage standards. Calgary’s established neighbourhoods have unique history, character, and architecture that should not be lost to one-size-fits-all development. Blanket upzoning risks erasing what makes these communities special. By putting enforceable heritage standards in place, we can accommodate growth while ensuring that new housing complements — rather than replaces — the history and identity of our neighbourhoods.",Yes,,,"Yes, I strongly support a more flexible and thoughtful planning approach. Blanket upzoning ignores infrastructure limits, strains services, and sidelines community voices. Instead, density should be added where it makes sense — near transit corridors, major roads, and underused commercial areas — with the proper infrastructure upgrades to support it. This way, we can grow sustainably while protecting greenspaces, respecting local context, and ensuring residents have a real say in shaping their communities.",Yes,,,"Yes, I support pausing and reviewing Local Area Plans. The current process has left many residents feeling that consultation was more of a formality than genuine engagement, with outcomes predetermined before communities had their say. That undermines trust in City Hall. We should return to a more open, transparent, and community-driven process — like the earlier ARPs — to ensure each neighbourhood has a real voice in shaping its future. Growth works best when it’s planned with communities, not imposed on them.",Yes,,,"Yes, the City should respect restrictive covenants when making planning decisions. These covenants are legally binding agreements under provincial law and reflect long-standing commitments that gave homeowners confidence when they chose their communities. Ignoring or bypassing them undermines trust and creates uncertainty for residents who expected those standards to be respected. The City must work within these covenants, not against them, to maintain fairness and consistency in planning decisions.",Yes,,,"Yes, the City should refrain from using Direct Control districts or other special zoning to override restrictive covenants. Doing so undermines both the legal standing of covenants and the trust residents place in the planning process. If changes are ever needed, they should come from the affected homeowners themselves — not be imposed unilaterally by City Hall.",,,,,,,,,,,,Ward 11,,,,Rob,Ward,,,info@robward11.ca,"Thank you for the opportunity to share my views. I believe Calgary needs thoughtful, community-driven growth — not one-size-fits-all blanket rezoning that ignores infrastructure limits, displaces affordable homes, and erodes neighbourhood character. I am committed to restoring genuine public engagement, protecting our tree canopy and greenspaces, and ensuring development benefits residents first, not speculators. My focus will always be on practical, balanced solutions that respect communities while planning responsibly for the future."
